            Fake base stations are often discussed as a threat for privacy of mobile phone users. However, many other devices, such as cars, lifts or industrial control systems (ICS), are increasingly using cellular connectivity. It makes some difficulties during penetration tests – even though data sent through this communication channel might be exactly the same as in case of using WiFi network, its access is much more difficult. Most security guidelines ignore this topic. It turns out that fake BTS, so often presented in a bad light, can be also used to support security examination of this communication channel. The presentation will be based on practice - built testbed and conducted experiments. In addition, hardware requirements for such environment and legal aspects in diffrent jurisdictions will be discussed.

            If you think an air gap prevents communication out of and into your industrial control system, you are wrong.

            We’ll be exploring various ways to send data across an air-gap in Industrial Control Systems and other environments, including a live demo.

            Is it really possible to send data across an air-gap where no network has been connected? (No we’re not talking about wifi, bluetooth, wirelessHART etc.)

            Can it be done without physical modification to your existing plant?

            Can we get that paragon of virtue- a data diode -to pass information in both directions without physically touching it?

            Find out.

            #### Audience
            Those who may have or consider an air-gap as part of their security.

            #### Take Away
            A better understanding of the history of jumping air-gaps and a new attack on data diodes.

          Get access this exciting two days deep dive workshop on SCADA honeypots. During the first day, the students will be guided in the different phases in planning, deploying and analyzing the collected data from a ICS/SCADA honeypot.

          ### Day 1
          #### Introduction to Honeypots systems, with special focus on ICS/SCADA)

          The first day, the students will introduced to different types of honeypot systems and pro/con's of each honeypot type.

          The students will be guided thou the different phases in planning, deploying and analyzing the collected data from a ICS/SCADA honeypot.

          We will deploy live honeypots on the internet and see how attackers would start to probe our honeypots. Furthermore, we will also attack the deployed honeypots ourselves; using SCADA pen testing tools and similar software. We will learn to spot various tools, and how to hide the signatures of a default honeypot. 

          ### Day 2
          #### Deploy more honeypots and move from low interaction to medium/high interaction Honeypots

          We will continue the modification of the SCADA honeypot from day 1 and will also deploy a new Internet based ICS/SCADA credential honeypot to our research arsenal - for further research/analyzing.

          The students will on day 2 build a purpose-build in-house Honeypot lab, where we change a low interaction honeypot to act as a realistic device (medium/high interaction honeypot) to ensure that attackers can't spot the honeypot 'a mile away'. This would give the students even better opportunity to do research/threat intelligence data on high interaction honeypots.

          The 2nd day would also provide opportunities to deep dive into students ideas for further activities after the workshop.

          #### Course syllabus

          * Introduction to Honeypots systems, with special focus on ICS/SCADA.
          * Building and Deployment of a live honeypot on the internet.
          * Useful tools to pentest SCADA honeypot systems
          * How to read the logs, and spot different attack types
          * Useful modification of the honeypot configuration
          * Learning how to build and deploy a medium/high interactive honeypot - for even better research data/TTP's
          * Closing remark and ideas for further activities.

          Each student will get access to a numbers of virtual lab servers to learn how to deploy and customize settings to avoid the default honeypot signature and evolve the low-interaction honeypot to be a true high interactive honeypot.

          #### Takeaway for participants

          After this 2 days workshop, you will be able to plan and deploy different types of ICS/SCADA related open source honeypots, either for research or to defend your corporate/industrial assets.
          You will understand different Honeypot types and deceptions methods.

          You will leave the class room with a knowledge on how to change the default signature on the honeypots and the understanding of the most common tools who will attack your honeypots.

          #### Requirements

          Students must bring a suitable laptop able to connect to the Internet. It must have a SSH client (Putty/term or similar software) installed. All lab servers are based on the internet, so no hypervisor like Vmware/VirtualBox are required on the student device. Knowledge of basic Linux commands, text editor and usage of the command line would be beneficial, but not a strict requirement to benefit from this course.

          #### Workshop Level

            Operator stations are today one of the first systems/stations to interact with a distributed control system (DCS) or other industrial control systems. These operator stations often have some protection built in to restrict what the operator can do within the SCADA software and/or on the operating system itself.
            
            Within this presentation, some of the most (easily) discovered ways are shown/explained and how these can be (ab)used to gain a further foothold within the environment.
            
            The audience will learn more on the shortcomings of most of the operator jail solutions and what could be done to step up this game to secure this properly. Key takeaways obtained by the audience through this presentation is that you cannot trust operator jails in the thought that it properly protects attackers from gaining access to the operating system itself and thus potentially exploiting the whole DCS environment.

            * Filter PCAP files and export frames to other tools
            * Keyword search
            * Create inventory of ICS devices from PCAP
          * Challenge Day 2
          
          #### The Scenario
          The scenario used in the class involves a new progressive Bank, which provides exchange services for Bitcoin and Litecoin. We’ve set up clients and a server for this bank using REAL physical machines and a REAL internet connection. All traffic on the network is captured to PCAP files by a SecurityOnion sensor. In the scenario this bank gets into lots of trouble with hackers and malware, such as:

          * Defacement of the Bank’s web server (see zone-h mirror)
          * Backdoor infection through trojanized software
          * Spear phishing
          * Use of a popular RAT (njRAT) to access the victims machine and exfiltrate the wallet.dat files for Bitcoin and Litecoin
          * Infection with real malware (Nemucod, Miuref / Boaxxe and more)
          
          Class attendees will learn to analyze captured network traffic from these events in order to:
          * Investigate web server compromises and defacements
          * Identify covert backdoors
          * Reassemble incoming emails and attachments
          * Detect and decode RAT/backdoor traffic
          * Detect malicious traffic without having to rely on blacklists, AV or third-party detection services
          
          Professional software included FREE of charge
          
          Each attendee will be provided with a free personal single user license of NetworkMiner Professional and CapLoader. These licenses will be valid for six months from the first training day.

          ### Target Audience

          Q: Who should attend?

          A: Anyone who want to improve their skills at finding evil stuff in full content packet captures.

          Q: Who should NOT attend?

          A: Those who are afraid of using Linux command line tools.

          ### Training Preparations

          Laptop Required
          Attendees will need to bring a laptop that fits the following specs:

          * A PC running any 64 bit Windows OS (can be a Virtual Machine)
          * At least 4GB RAM
          * At least 40 GB free disk space
          * VirtualBox (64 bit) installed (VMWare will not be supported in the training)
          * A VirtualBox VM will be provided on USB flash drives at the beginning of the training.

          Please note that having a 64-bit CPU and a 64-bit OS is not always enough to support 64-bit virtualization. You might need to enable features such as ”AMD-V”, ”VT-x” or ”Hyper-V” in BIOS in order to run virtual machines in 64-bit mode. You might also need to turn off “Intel Trusted Execution” in BIOS. One way to verify that your laptop supports 64-bit virtualization is to download the SecurityOnion ISO and see if it boots up in VirtualBox.

          * A PC running any 64 bit Windows OS (can be a Virtual Machine)
          * At least 4GB RAM
          * At least 40 GB free disk space
          * VirtualBox (64 bit) installed (VMWare will not be supported in the training)

          A VirtualBox VM will be provided on USB flash drives at the beginning of the training.

          Please note that having a 64-bit CPU and a 64-bit OS is not always enough to support 64-bit virtualization. You might need to enable features such as ”AMD-V”, ”VT-x” or ”Hyper-V” in BIOS in order to run virtual machines in 64-bit mode. You might also need to turn off "Intel Trusted Execution" in BIOS. One way to verify that your laptop supports 64-bit virtualization is to download the SecurityOnion ISO and see if it boots up in VirtualBox.

              Over the last decade, two instances of industrial control system (ICS) targeted malware successfully impacted operations. Most recently, CRASHOVERRIDE targeted a Ukrainian transmission substation in December of 2016. In both cases, attackers developed malware that crafted industrial protocol packets to manipulate control systems either by hijacking the legitimate master server or hooking the network stack. Defense against properly crafted packets presents a unique challenge as many existing approaches simply analyze the integrity of a single packet. This talk will focus on what stateful analysis is and how you can add it to your detection or hunting strategy to perform deep protocol analysis. We will cover the steps necessary to begin stateful analysis and dive into thresholds you might set for detection.

        description: |
          Generation, storage, transport and distribution of electricity and gas are the most critical of all critical infrastructure processes supporting our daily life. As in every modern industry domain, energy supply is heavily dependent on industrial control systems (ICS) and the security of these systems. While many energy utilities implement an information security management system (ISMS) based on the ISO/IEC 27000 standard family, they often struggle with the inclusion of the ICS and OT domain, when they try to harmonize security management over their entire business scope. To fill this gap ISO/IEC 27019 *Information security controls for the energy utility industry* was developed. ISO/IEC 27019 is a sector specific control set for the process control system domain of the energy sector which is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002. 
          
          To supplement the generic controls of ISO/IEC 27019 with detailed technical security specifications for ICS systems, the German and Austrian energy operator associations BDEW and Oesterreichs Energie have published the BDEW/OE Whitepaper. The Whitepaper can be used during system procurement and defines security requirements for control and automation systems of the energy domain and their telecommunication infrastructure.

          The workshop gives an introduction to the contents and practical application of ISO/IEC 27019 and the BDEW/OE Whitepaper. The following topics will be covered:
          * Industrial control systems in the energy sector 
          * Introduction to the ISO/IEC 27000 series
          * Overview of ISO/IEC 27019 
          * Practical application of ISO/IEC 27019
          * ISO/IEC 27019 and European cyber security regulation 
          * The BDEW/OE Whitepaper, a security procurement guideline for energy ICS

          The workshop will include a lecture, discussions and exercises.

        description: |
          On this intense 2-days training, you will learn everything you need to start pentesting Industrial Control Networks. We will cover the basics to help you understand what are the most common ICS vulnerabilities.

          We will then spend some time learning and exploiting Windows & Active Directory weaknesses, as most ICS are controlled by Windows systems. We will cover the most common ICS protocols (Modbus, S7, Profinet, Ethernet/IP, DNP3, OPC…), analyze packet captures and learn how to use these protocols to talk to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

          You will learn how to program a PLC, to better understand how to exploit them. The training will end with an afternoon dedicated to a challenging hands-on exercise: The first CTF in which you capture a real flag! Using your newly acquired skills, you will try to compromise a Windows Active Directory, pivot to an ICS setup to take control of a model train and robotic arms.

          #### The detailed outline of the training will be the following:

          - Introduction to ICS & common vulnerabilities
          - Pentesting Basics & tools [Hands-on]
          - Windows basics and pentesting Windows [Hands-on]
          - Focus on ICS protocols
          - Programming PLCs [Hands-on]
          - Pentesting ICS [Hands-on]
          - Capture The Flag [Hands-on]

          ### Detailed content

          #### Module 1: Introduction to ICS & common vulnerabilities

          For starters, I will introduce the concept of ICS.

          The topics will include:
          - Vocabulary
          - Classic architectures
          - ICS components (PLCs, HMI, SCADA, DCS, sensors, RTUs, Historian, etc) and their roles
          - OT vs IT

          I will also introduce attendees to the most common vulnerabilities in ICS, and describes some of the public attacks:
          - Lack of network segmentation / Exposure
          - Lack of hardening - ICS protocols insecurity

          *This module is not hands-on*


          #### Module 2: Pentesting Basics & tools

          This module will introduce the concept of penetration test.
          I do not intend to spend too much time of the theoretical stuff (how to make
          a report, etc etc) since that is not what attendees are looking for.

          However, I think a module is required to ensure that everyone shares at least the
          basic concepts of penetration testing, in order to understand the rest of the training.
          The module will include :
          - OSINT for ICS : Where to look to find informations
          - Reconnaissance : how to portscan & nessus
          - Exploitation : Metasploit basics

          Toolz used : nmap, Nessus, Metasploit

          Lab setup : Windows Servers and workstations, Metasploitable, Kali Linux

          #### Module 3: Windows basics and pentesting Windows
          Any ICS now includes, at least in some areas, Windows systems. So I think that some time must be spent on Windows basics.

          This module will introduce the following topics: 
          - Windows Active Directory
          - How to find credentials on Windows systems
          - Exploiting and pivoting to gain Domain Admin privileges

          A selection of hacking techniques will be applied on lab machines.

          #### Module 4: Focus on ICS protocols

          This module will introduce the most common ICS protocols: Modbus/TCP, S7, Profinet, DNP3, Ethernet/IP…. Attendees will analyze network captures and be introduced to software libraries/ clients to use these protocols to talk to PLC simulators.

          *This module is not hands-on*

          #### Module 5: Programming PLCs
          In order to have a better understanding of how a PLC works, student will use dedicated software to program a PLC in ladder logic (using trial versions of TIA portal and/or soMachine basic).

          Students will then deploy the code to real PLCs.

          Toolz used : SoMachine Basic

          Lab : Windows virtual machine

          #### Module 6: Pentesting ICS
          This module will be mostly lab sessions, in order to apply the knowledge learned so far:
          - Network capture analysis & replaying packets
          - Talking industrial protocols: Modbus, S7
          - Additional PLC features: web server, ftp, snmp and how to exploit it

          Toolz used : nmap, Nessus, Metasploit

          Lab : Windows Servers and workstations, Kali Linux, Siemens and Schneider PLCs

          #### Module 7: Capture The Flag

          I strongly believe that a good training must include “real-life” examples and labs. I will dedicate the last half-day of the training to a Capture The Flag event. To do so, I will have a specific setup where attendees will be able to use their newly-acquired knowledge on a simulation of a “real-life” system. This will include compromise of Windows host, pivoting to the ICS, understanding the industrial process, and finally capturing a real flag with a robot hand!

          This will be an expanded version of the CTF I usually organize during the ICS workshops at conferences.

          #### Target audience
          This training is aimed at OT professionals willing to understand what are the security issues within ICS, and how
          to technically assess the security level of an ICS. It will also be beneficial for IT security professionals wanting to understand the technical specificities of ICS.

          #### Key takeaways
          The attendees will learn what are the common ICS vulnerabilities, the tools and techniques to assess an ICS (both Windows systems and PLCs), and will practice these techniques during an hands-on Capture The Flag on real hardware.

          #### Training Preparations
          Laptop Required

          Attendees will need to bring a laptop that fits the following specs:

          * A PC with VirtualBox capable of running virtual machines.
          * At least 4GB RAM
          * At least 40 GB free disk space
          * VirtualBox (64 bit) installed (VMWare could be used but will not be supported in the training)

          Several VirtualBox VMs will be provided on USB flash drives at the beginning of the training.

          Please note that having a 64-bit CPU and a 64-bit OS is not always enough to support 64-bit virtualization. You might need to enable features such as ”AMD-V”, ”VT-x” or ”Hyper-V” in BIOS in order to run virtual machines in 64-bit mode.

          Please try to run a 64-bit VM prior to the training.

            Abstract: Innovative and disruptive technologies are enhancing and invading our traditional industrial business model. Future infrastructure organizations will need more data to operate efficiently and succeed in the brave new interconnected world. The diversity of new technologies and data will fuel more diversity in business opportunity. Everyone expects more OT, more IOT, and more IT - and all of it is supposed to be highly reliable and secure. These factors (and more) lead to a landscape shift for the industrial cybersecurity risk profile. In this session, hear ways to recognize the problems and gain some clarity on possible solutions through historic lessons, made up words, and practical front-line experience.

            Introducing the honeypot project, which will be an open source project, allowing anyone to run a small honeypot in their network. The idea of this project is to let anyone clone the git repo and then setup his own IoT honeypot anywhere using Docker virtualization platform. The project will be announced for the first time at your conference, as I’m still polishing right now.

            Showing the latest attacks captured by the honeypots that are deployed mostly in Romania, in residential networks. The main assumption is that attackers are actually avoiding honeypots running in main VPS providers ASNs / IP ranges and are actually targeting residential networks. So I did just that: installed honeypots in 5 big Romanian ISPs. They account for more than 80% of all RO residential networks. The moment we installed these honeypots, we started seeing attacks. They were not just a few, so I will discuss about trends: for example how attackers are reacting to publicly released new 0day exploits by improving the attack methods. I will present a comprehensive view and the current attack trends at global scale ( data provided by honeypots installed all around the world) and at a country level (data provided by the honeypots installed in Romanian residential networks).

            Once we collected network attacks I started checking the payload or bash commands the attackers were sending. This allowed me to fetch some fresh/interesting samples (this part was not presented at SAS due to time constraints). I will talk about these samples as well.

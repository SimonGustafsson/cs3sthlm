Adopting a critical examination of ICS infrastructure and communication channels provides defenders with a means to prioritize and focus network protection.

By identifying network 'key terrain' and focusing operations on these critical path nodes, defenders can significantly reduce freedom of movement for adversaries and reduce the time from initial compromise to detection. Ultimately, by 'knowing the network' and having an understanding of attacker methodology, ICS network defenders can take the initiative in a cyber breach or attack scenario away from the attacker and empower critical infrastructure defense. To illustrate these concepts, the above will be discussed in light of two recent threats to the ICS environment: the wormable, ETERNALBLUE-employing ransomware WannaCry; and the electric grid-targeting malware CrashOverride/Industroyer.

	      <p>The security lab is returning to the conference. This year the lab will be a bigger, better and more interesting than ever before. We have added alot of more ICS and ICS communication equipment to the lab. We have extended it with a part that is for IoT security.</p>

	    	<p>Similar to one of the previous year, we plan to record and release the traffic in the ICS lab network.</p>

	  		<p>We encurrage both newcomers as well as experts to connect to the environment to play with the available equipment. Newcomers will have help to get started by having some examples that they can test and learn from. More experienced users will be able to poke harder at the systems.</p>

	  		<h3 class="headline">Rules of Engagement</h3>
	  		<p>We have drafted a document that describes the "rules of engagement" for the using the lab. The rules should make it easier for everyone to understand what is OK and what is not OK to do in the lab environment. It all boils down to being a "good neighbour" that does not interfere, destroy or make trouble for others. </p>
	  	</div>
	  	<div class="col-2-6">
	  		<p>The rules of engagement is also a way to show to the general public that we bring this equipment to the conference for two purposes: one is to give people access to equipment that they normally cannot put their hands on and to allow them to learn about them. The second purpose, is that if we find flaws or problems with the equipment, we will hand them over to KraftCERT that is on site, that in turn with coordinate disclosure with vendors. This is described in the document.</p>

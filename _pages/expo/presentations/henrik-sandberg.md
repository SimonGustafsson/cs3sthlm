In this talk, we discuss how control theory can contribute to the analysis and design of secure cyber-physical systems. We start by reviewing conditions for detectability and impact of data attacks targeting feedback control loops running over a field communication network. We investigate three different attack scenarios: Sensor attacks, actuator attacks, and coordinated actuator and sensor attacks. In particular, we highlight how a physical understanding of the controlled process can guide us in the allocation of counter measures and limit the possible impact of attacks.

        Our two-day Network Forensics class consists of a mix of theory and hands-on labs, where students will learn to analyze Full Packet Capture (FPC) files. The scenarios in the labs are primarily focused at network forensics for incident response, but are also relevant for law enforcement/internal security etc. where the network traffic of a suspect or insider is being monitored.
        
        #### Day 1 - Theory and Practice using Open Source Tools 
        * Theory: Ethernet signaling
        * Hardware: Network TAPs and Monitor ports / SPAN ports
        * Sniffers: Recommendations for high-performance packet interception
        * Analyze Modbus TCP traffic
        * Forensics of IEC 60870-5-104 network traffic
        * Investigate telnet sessions
        * PCAP analysis: Extracting evidence and indicators of compromise using open source tools
        * Defeating Big Data: Techniques for working with large data sets
        * Whitelists: Learn how to detect 0-day exploit attacks without using IDS signatures
        * Challenge Day 1: Find the needle in our haystack and win a honorable prize!

        #### Day 2 - Advanced Network Forensics using Netresec Tools 
        * NetworkMiner Professional: Learning to leverage the features available in the Pro version

          * Filter PCAP files and export frames to other tools
          * Keyword search
          * Create inventory of ICS devices from PCAP
        * Challenge Day 2

        #### The Scenario

        The scenario used in the class involves a new progressive Bank, which provides exchange services for Bitcoin and Litecoin. We've set up clients and a server for this bank using REAL physical machines and a REAL internet connection. All traffic on the network is captured to PCAP files by a SecurityOnion sensor. In the scenario this bank gets into lots of trouble with hackers and malware, such as:

        * Defacement of the Bank's web server (see zone-h mirror)
        * Backdoor infection through trojanized software
        * Spear phishing
        * Use of a popular RAT (njRAT) to access the victims machine and exfiltrate the wallet.dat files for Bitcoin and Litecoin
        * Infection with real malware (Nemucod, Miuref / Boaxxe and more)

        Class attendees will learn to analyze captured network traffic from these events in order to:
        * Investigate web server compromises and defacements
        * Identify covert backdoors
        * Reassemble incoming emails and attachments
        * Detect and decode RAT/backdoor traffic
        * Detect malicious traffic without having to rely on blacklists, AV or third-party detection services

        #### Professional software included FREE of charge 
        Each attendee will be provided with a free personal single user license of NetworkMiner Professional and CapLoader. These licenses will be valid for six months from the first training day.

        ### Target Audience

        Q: Who should attend?

        A: Anyone who want to improve their skills at finding evil stuff in full content packet captures.

        Q: Who should NOT attend?

        A: Those who are afraid of using Linux command line tools.

        ### Training Preparations

        #### Laptop Required 
        Attendees will need to bring a laptop that fits the following specs:

        * A PC running any 64 bit Windows OS (can be a Virtual Machine)
        * At least 4GB RAM
        * At least 40 GB free disk space
        * VirtualBox (64 bit) installed (VMWare will not be supported in the training)

        A VirtualBox VM will be provided on USB flash drives at the beginning of the training.

        Please note that having a 64-bit CPU and a 64-bit OS is not always enough to support 64-bit virtualization. You might need to enable features such as ”AMD-V”, ”VT-x” or ”Hyper-V” in BIOS in order to run virtual machines in 64-bit mode. You might also need to turn off "Intel Trusted Execution" in BIOS. One way to verify that your laptop supports 64-bit virtualization is to download the SecurityOnion ISO and see if it boots up in VirtualBox.

      description: |
        Generation, storage, transport and distribution of electricity and gas are the most critical of all critical infrastructure processes supporting our daily life. As in every modern industry domain, energy supply is heavily dependent on industrial control systems (ICS) and the security of these systems. While many energy utilities implement an information security management system (ISMS) based on the ISO/IEC 27000 standard family, they often struggle with the inclusion of the ICS and OT domain, when they try to harmonize security management over their entire business scope. To fill this gap ISO/IEC 27019 *Information security controls for the energy utility industry* was developed. ISO/IEC 27019 is a sector specific control set for the process control system domain of the energy sector which is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002. 
        
        To supplement the generic controls of ISO/IEC 27019 with detailed technical security specifications for ICS systems, the German and Austrian energy operator associations BDEW and Oesterreichs Energie have published the BDEW/OE Whitepaper. The Whitepaper can be used during system procurement and defines security requirements for control and automation systems of the energy domain and their telecommunication infrastructure.

        The workshop gives an introduction to the contents and practical application of ISO/IEC 27019 and the BDEW/OE Whitepaper. The following topics will be covered:
        * Industrial control systems in the energy sector 
        * Introduction to the ISO/IEC 27000 series
        * Overview of ISO/IEC 27019 
        * Practical application of ISO/IEC 27019
        * ISO/IEC 27019 and European cyber security regulation 
        * The BDEW/OE Whitepaper, a security procurement guideline for energy ICS

        The workshop will include a lecture, discussions and exercises.

        Industrial Control Systems (ICS) as well as Operational Technology (OT) are under increased risks from cyber events.  Come learn how Cyber Informed Engineering is an evolving concept to use cyber risk in designing control systems and associated protection systems.
    
        “Cyber risks to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) continue to evolve.  Whether it is the threat of ransomware taking a production system offline, or sophisticated malware targeting the safety critical components of your system.  Engineers have long designed systems to be resilient to a multitude of failure modes, and it is time that we started taking the lessons learned from cyber attacks against these systems into consideration during new system design, or legacy system retrofit.  This session will introduce this evolving concept and describe some of the standards and practices being developed and utilized.”

        On this intense 2-days training, you will learn everything you need to start pentesting Industrial Control Networks. We will cover the basics to help you understand what are the most common ICS vulnerabilities.

        We will then spend some time learning and exploiting Windows & Active Directory weaknesses, as most ICS are controlled by Windows systems. We will cover the most common ICS protocols (Modbus, S7, Profinet, Ethernet/IP, DNP3, OPC…), analyze packet captures and learn how to use these protocols to talk to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

        You will learn how to program a PLC, to better understand how to exploit them. The training will end with an afternoon dedicated to a challenging hands-on exercise: The first CTF in which you capture a real flag! Using your newly acquired skills, you will try to compromise a Windows Active Directory, pivot to an ICS setup to take control of a model train and robotic arms.

        #### The detailed outline of the training will be the following:

        - Introduction to ICS & common vulnerabilities
        - Pentesting Basics & tools [Hands-on]
        - Windows basics and pentesting Windows [Hands-on]
        - Focus on ICS protocols
        - Programming PLCs [Hands-on]
        - Pentesting ICS [Hands-on]
        - Capture The Flag [Hands-on]

        ### Detailed content

        #### Module 1: Introduction to ICS & common vulnerabilities

        For starters, I will introduce the concept of ICS.

        The topics will include:
        - Vocabulary
        - Classic architectures
        - ICS components (PLCs, HMI, SCADA, DCS, sensors, RTUs, Historian, etc) and their roles
        - OT vs IT

        I will also introduce attendees to the most common vulnerabilities in ICS, and describes some of the public attacks:
        - Lack of network segmentation / Exposure
        - Lack of hardening - ICS protocols insecurity

        *This module is not hands-on*


        #### Module 2: Pentesting Basics & tools

        This module will introduce the concept of penetration test.
        I do not intend to spend too much time of the theoretical stuff (how to make
        a report, etc etc) since that is not what attendees are looking for.

        However, I think a module is required to ensure that everyone shares at least the
        basic concepts of penetration testing, in order to understand the rest of the training.
        The module will include :
        - OSINT for ICS : Where to look to find informations
        - Reconnaissance : how to portscan & nessus
        - Exploitation : Metasploit basics

        Toolz used : nmap, Nessus, Metasploit

        Lab setup : Windows Servers and workstations, Metasploitable, Kali Linux

        #### Module 3: Windows basics and pentesting Windows
        Any ICS now includes, at least in some areas, Windows systems. So I think that some time must be spent on Windows basics.

        This module will introduce the following topics: 
        - Windows Active Directory
        - How to find credentials on Windows systems
        - Exploiting and pivoting to gain Domain Admin privileges

        A selection of hacking techniques will be applied on lab machines.

        #### Module 4: Focus on ICS protocols

        This module will introduce the most common ICS protocols: Modbus/TCP, S7, Profinet, DNP3, Ethernet/IP…. Attendees will analyze network captures and be introduced to software libraries/ clients to use these protocols to talk to PLC simulators.

        *This module is not hands-on*

        #### Module 5: Programming PLCs
        In order to have a better understanding of how a PLC works, student will use dedicated software to program a PLC in ladder logic (using trial versions of TIA portal and/or soMachine basic).

        Students will then deploy the code to real PLCs.

        Toolz used : SoMachine Basic

        Lab : Windows virtual machine

        #### Module 6: Pentesting ICS
        This module will be mostly lab sessions, in order to apply the knowledge learned so far:
        - Network capture analysis & replaying packets
        - Talking industrial protocols: Modbus, S7
        - Additional PLC features: web server, ftp, snmp and how to exploit it

        Toolz used : nmap, Nessus, Metasploit

        Lab : Windows Servers and workstations, Kali Linux, Siemens and Schneider PLCs

        #### Module 7: Capture The Flag

        I strongly believe that a good training must include “real-life” examples and labs. I will dedicate the last half-day of the training to a Capture The Flag event. To do so, I will have a specific setup where attendees will be able to use their newly-acquired knowledge on a simulation of a “real-life” system. This will include compromise of Windows host, pivoting to the ICS, understanding the industrial process, and finally capturing a real flag with a robot hand!

        This will be an expanded version of the CTF I usually organize during the ICS workshops at conferences.

        #### Target audience
        This training is aimed at OT professionals willing to understand what are the security issues within ICS, and how
        to technically assess the security level of an ICS. It will also be beneficial for IT security professionals wanting to understand the technical specificities of ICS.

        #### Key takeaways
        The attendees will learn what are the common ICS vulnerabilities, the tools and techniques to assess an ICS (both Windows systems and PLCs), and will practice these techniques during an hands-on Capture The Flag on real hardware.

        #### Training Preparations
        Laptop Required

        Attendees will need to bring a laptop that fits the following specs:

        * A PC with VirtualBox capable of running virtual machines.
        * At least 4GB RAM
        * At least 40 GB free disk space
        * VirtualBox (64 bit) installed (VMWare could be used but will not be supported in the training)

        Several VirtualBox VMs will be provided on USB flash drives at the beginning of the training.

        Please note that having a 64-bit CPU and a 64-bit OS is not always enough to support 64-bit virtualization. You might need to enable features such as ”AMD-V”, ”VT-x” or ”Hyper-V” in BIOS in order to run virtual machines in 64-bit mode.

        Please try to run a 64-bit VM prior to the training.

        The ICS lab is an critical resource, and not just for a solution provider like Siemens.  While the internal components of a lab may vary widely (witness the CS3STHLM ICS lab for example), the process of securing access to the lab network, while assuring availability and ease of use arguably has some common goals. Siemens PD Solutions in Bergen, Norway recently relocated their lab, and developed this presentation in the hope that their security and optimization solutions specifically related to the network might be of interest to others. Especially those with large, productive, multi-project, multi-customer lab environments.

These operator stations often have some protection built in to restrict what the operator can do within the SCADA software and/or on the operating system itself.
        
        Within this presentation, some of the most (easily) discovered ways are shown/explained and how these can be (ab)used to gain a further foothold within the environment.
        
        The audience will learn more on the shortcomings of most of the operator jail solutions and what could be done to step up this game to secure this properly. Key takeaways obtained by the audience through this presentation is that you cannot trust operator jails in the thought that it properly protects attackers from gaining access to the operating system itself and thus potentially exploiting the whole DCS environment.

        “Network Segmentation” is a simple concept of 20 characters (space included). Doing it in practice and doing it right is much more difficult. Proper segmentation is much, much more than just adding a firewall.

        Over the last years we spend a lot of time and money on designing and implementing network segmentation for our multi-site IT and multi-site OT networks. Not only in technical solutions, but also in the required processes for maintaining the new environment. We made some (costly) mistakes and had to rethink our design based on physical and organizational boundaries.

        In this talk, we would like to present lessons-learned on the multi-million, multi-year project. It is not an official report-out, but a hands-on and practical presentation. We hope this talk will give the audience a feeling for the challenges of a proper segmentation program and help them to prevent some of the mistakes we made.

        #### The following questions will be answered
        
        * How did we convince Senior Management to allocate the budget
        * What underlying architecture did we choose and why?
        * What use cases did we envision and how did we work them out?
        * What design choices were made?
        * How did this work out in reality?
        * What did we learn?
        * What would we recommend?
        * What would we do differently?

        Over the last years we spend a lot of time and money on designing and implementing network segmentation for our multi-site IT and multi-site OT networks. Not only in technical solutions, but also in the required processes for maintaining the new environment. We made some (costly) mistakes and had to rethink our design based on physical and organizational boundaries.

        In this talk, we would like to present lessons-learned on the multi-million, multi-year project. It is not an official report-out, but a hands-on and practical presentation. We hope this talk will give the audience a feeling for the challenges of a proper segmentation program and help them to prevent some of the mistakes we made.

        #### The following questions will be answered
        
        * How did we convince Senior Management to allocate the budget
        * What underlying architecture did we choose and why?
        * What use cases did we envision and how did we work them out?
        * What design choices were made?
        * How did this work out in reality?
        * What did we learn?
        * What would we recommend?
        * What would we do differently?

        Get access this exciting two days deep dive workshop on SCADA honeypots. During the first day, the students will be guided in the different phases in planning, deploying and analyzing the collected data from a ICS/SCADA honeypot.

        ### Day 1
        #### Introduction to Honeypots systems, with special focus on ICS/SCADA)

        The first day, the students will introduced to different types of honeypot systems and pro/con's of each honeypot type.

        The students will be guided thou the different phases in planning, deploying and analyzing the collected data from a ICS/SCADA honeypot.

        We will deploy live honeypots on the internet and see how attackers would start to probe our honeypots. Furthermore, we will also attack the deployed honeypots ourselves; using SCADA pen testing tools and similar software. We will learn to spot various tools, and how to hide the signatures of a default honeypot. 

        ### Day 2
        #### Deploy more honeypots and move from low interaction to medium/high interaction Honeypots

        We will continue the modification of the SCADA honeypot from day 1 and will also deploy a new Internet based ICS/SCADA credential honeypot to our research arsenal - for further research/analyzing.

        The students will on day 2 build a purpose-build in-house Honeypot lab, where we change a low interaction honeypot to act as a realistic device (medium/high interaction honeypot) to ensure that attackers can't spot the honeypot 'a mile away'. This would give the students even better opportunity to do research/threat intelligence data on high interaction honeypots.

        The 2nd day would also provide opportunities to deep dive into students ideas for further activities after the workshop.

        #### Course syllabus

        * Introduction to Honeypots systems, with special focus on ICS/SCADA.
        * Building and Deployment of a live honeypot on the internet.
        * Useful tools to pentest SCADA honeypot systems
        * How to read the logs, and spot different attack types
        * Useful modification of the honeypot configuration
        * Learning how to build and deploy a medium/high interactive honeypot - for even better research data/TTP's
        * Closing remark and ideas for further activities.

        Each student will get access to a numbers of virtual lab servers to learn how to deploy and customize settings to avoid the default honeypot signature and evolve the low-interaction honeypot to be a true high interactive honeypot.

        #### Takeaway for participants

        After this 2 days workshop, you will be able to plan and deploy different types of ICS/SCADA related open source honeypots, either for research or to defend your corporate/industrial assets.
        You will understand different Honeypot types and deceptions methods.

        You will leave the class room with a knowledge on how to change the default signature on the honeypots and the understanding of the most common tools who will attack your honeypots.

        #### Requirements

        Students must bring a suitable laptop able to connect to the Internet. It must have a SSH client (Putty/term or similar software) installed. All lab servers are based on the internet, so no hypervisor like Vmware/VirtualBox are required on the student device. Knowledge of basic Linux commands, text editor and usage of the command line would be beneficial, but not a strict requirement to benefit from this course.

        #### Workshop Level

        In the past few years, the attacks to industrial control systems(ICS) has increased year by year. Most of the attacks are exploit of the insecurity of ICS protocols like Stuxnet in 2010, Triton in 2017.
        
        In 2016, Ralf Spenneberg and et al give a presentation named PLC Blaster which demonstrates a worm lives and runs on Siemens S7-1200 PLCs, they use S7commplus protocol to transmit worms in PLCs. In this research, we proposed an attack method that a PLC can attack other different vendors’ PLCs inside the net.
        
        If one PLC is infected, this PLC can scan the whole net to find all kinds of PLCs and send back the information back to a Command &Control server. Then, once received the command from C&C server, this infected PLC can do attacks to other different vendors’ PLCs. Like PLC Blaster, this malware can be spread inside the net.

        If you think an air gap prevents communication out of and into your industrial control system, you are wrong.

        We’ll be exploring various ways to send data across an air-gap in Industrial Control Systems and other environments, including a live demo.

        Is it really possible to send data across an air-gap where no network has been connected? (No we’re not talking about wifi, bluetooth, wirelessHART etc.)

        Can it be done without physical modification to your existing plant?

        Can we get that paragon of virtue- a data diode -to pass information in both directions without physically touching it?

        Find out.

        #### Audience
        Those who may have or consider an air-gap as part of their security.

        #### Take Away
        A better understanding of the history of jumping air-gaps and a new attack on data diodes.

      permalink: program/presentations/joe-slowik/
      description: |
        As ICS defense and detection matures, both defenders and products move increasingly away from traditional IOC approaches to newer, more robust models: anomaly detection, and threat behavioral analytics. While an appropriate, defense-in-depth position would work to integrate both approaches into a single defensive schema, scarce resources and funding constraints mean that organizations will need to choose one or the other for their monitoring and detection needs.
        
        After providing an overview of both these approaches to threat detection, this presentation will then critically evaluate what these approaches enable from a defensive perspective as specifically required for ICS networks. The result will not just be a simple ‘product type’ comparison, but rather a robust investigation of the theoretical underpinnings of these approaches, and what they enable a defender to accomplish within the monitored network. Specific details will include completeness of coverage beyond ‘known bad’ items; ability to incorporate contextualization into alerting; and capability for detecting realistic threats in the ICS environment.
        
        To provide appropriate context to the discussion, the approaches will be compared to ICS intrusion examples as a means of evaluating their efficacy and viability. By adopting a critical approach to this evaluation, ICS defense practitioners can gain insight into the true costs and benefits of anomaly detection and threat behavior analytics. The expected result of this presentation will be an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches with respect to the specific requirements for ICS defense, enabling attendees to evaluate relative to their own operational needs which approach works best for their environment.

      permalink: program/trainings/joe-slowik/
      description: |
        Network defense is informed by knowing the network, and knowing the adversary – but few practitioners have the fortune of possessing this knowledge before a major breach. Industrial Control System (ICS) networks provide particular challenges due to limitations on operational testing and traditional red team exercises. To address the need for critical assessment of ICS-related networks for developing defensive strategy, this training provides attendees with a comprehensive exercise to identify critical network assets within a theoretical IT and ICS environment, driven by threat intelligence and threat actor profiles.

        Starting with an overview of strategy and applying strategic concepts to network defense, attendees will formulate a comprehensive, adversary-oriented network defense plan covering IT and ICS environments. Following additional overview and critique of planning, attendees will then test the plan through an iterative, guided wargaming exercise – the goal being to test planning comprehensiveness, identify gaps, and improve planning and implementation over time. This training is suitable for all levels of security practitioner – from CISO to SOC analyst – as a means to improve and refine defensive planning, especially within environments containing ICS.

        #### Who Should Attend

        * Security senior decision makers, from project managers through CIOs.
        * ICS network operations personnel responsible for assessing risk or managing network security.
        * Security operations personnel, either focused on ICS environment or general IT security, with an interest in network security strategy development.

        #### Key Learning Objectives:

        * How to assess the security threat environment to identify threats facing the organization.
        * Apply threat assessment information to the organization’s security environment to formulate an
        actionable, working network defense strategy.
        * Learn to critically analyze network defense planning activity and technical controls to identify detection and visibility gaps.
        * Gain experience in developing and executing interactive exercises to test security plans to evaluate effectiveness and relevance.
        * Learn how to apply and interpret testing results to improve security planning over time, and adapt to a changing threat environment.

        Over the last decade, two instances of industrial control system (ICS) targeted malware successfully impacted operations. Most recently, CRASHOVERRIDE targeted a Ukrainian transmission substation in December of 2016. In both cases, attackers developed malware that crafted industrial protocol packets to manipulate control systems either by hijacking the legitimate master server or hooking the network stack. Defense against properly crafted packets presents a unique challenge as many existing approaches simply analyze the integrity of a single packet. This talk will focus on what stateful analysis is and how you can add it to your detection or hunting strategy to perform deep protocol analysis. We will cover the steps necessary to begin stateful analysis and dive into thresholds you might set for detection.

        Most Industrial Control System (ICS) networks require Incident Response (IR) procedures. Generally, these procedures fulfill regulatory requirements and do little to actually prepare the organization for handling an incident. Additionally, too many IR procedures relay on government programs (CERTS, committees, investigative boards). These programs may not provide the resource required and should not be considered a single point of response. This lecture will concentrate on concepts organizations should implement that decrease required resources for IR, arm responders, work with 3rd parties, and facilitate a return to operations. 
        
        This lecture will not cover general IR planning but rather focus on IR considerations within ICS. Network topologies, workflows, and approved actions differ from regular IT networks. Without understanding these differences, rash decisions during IR can have more negative impacts than the actual incident caused.
        
        Key takeaways include action items an organization should consider when creating cybersecurity policies, IR procedures, and contract negotiations with 3rd party security vendors.
        
        #### Learning Objectives
        This session will arm participants with knowledge of common IR procedural shortfalls through case studies and examples from the field. This session will provide attendees with specific checklists for consideration when drafting IR procedures. This session will give attendees action items for enhancing existing IR procedures.

        #### Business Impact
        Planning around internal resources for incident handling is required within ICS environments and is especially important as the consequences of poor decisions can result in loss safety and even loss of life.

        This one day class is an introduction to threat hunting and incident response for ICS environments. We will overview the business and security use cases of when and why threat hunting is valuable to organizations. We will progress by applying these concepts to corporate environments and industrial environments such as transmission or distribution control facilities, or plant distributed control systems (DCS).

        This class will serve as an introduction to key concepts and provide a framework to develop active defenses for analysts and leadership. For existing active defense practitioners we will also include demonstrations of tools and tactics that can be immediately applied.

        #### Outline
        * Definition of threat hunting
        * NSM, data pivoting

        Over the last decade, two instances of industrial control system (ICS) targeted malware successfully impacted operations. Most recently, CRASHOVERRIDE targeted a Ukrainian transmission substation in December of 2016. In both cases, attackers developed malware that crafted industrial protocol packets to manipulate control systems either by hijacking the legitimate master server or hooking the network stack. Defense against properly crafted packets presents a unique challenge as many existing approaches simply analyze the integrity of a single packet. This talk will focus on what stateful analysis is and how you can add it to your detection or hunting strategy to perform deep protocol analysis. We will cover the steps necessary to begin stateful analysis and dive into thresholds you might set for detection.

      partner:
      description: |
        Fake base stations are often discussed as a threat for privacy of mobile phone users. However, many other devices, such as cars, lifts or industrial control systems (ICS), are increasingly using cellular connectivity. It makes some difficulties during penetration tests – even though data sent through this communication channel might be exactly the same as in case of using WiFi network, its access is much more difficult. Most security guidelines ignore this topic. It turns out that fake BTS, so often presented in a bad light, can be also used to support security examination of this communication channel. The presentation will be based on practice - built testbed and conducted experiments. In addition, hardware requirements for such environment and legal aspects in diffrent jurisdictions will be discussed.

        In this talk, we discuss how control theory can contribute to the analysis and design of secure cyber-physical systems. We start by reviewing conditions for detectability and impact of data attacks targeting feedback control loops running over a field communication network. We investigate three different attack scenarios: Sensor attacks, actuator attacks, and coordinated actuator and sensor attacks. In particular, we highlight how a physical understanding of the controlled process can guide us in the allocation of counter measures and limit the possible impact of attacks.

      description: |
        Critical infrastructure security relies heavily on the security of the software and hardware that provide the basic execution platforms upon which various types of embedded controllers are implemented. Formal methods have been used, in the Cerces project and elsewhere, to formally prove the security of various types of hypervisors, microkernels, and separation kernel, based on relative simple models of the underlying hardware. The continuing stream of attacks on this hardware reveals that more refined microarchitectural models are needed. We present some recent work in this direction that is able to formally establish critical security properties, in the presence of some microarchitectural vulnerabilities.

        * A definition of the dark web and how it differs from other sources of intelligence
        * Real-world examples of threat actor activities in dark marketplaces
        * Methods for uncovering emerging threats using dark web sources

        The momentum behind the convergence of historically distinct and separate domains illuminates the importance of seeking to implement robust security to protect highly valued assets that are In many instances delivering essential global services.

        The stakes in the game of outmaneuvering the adversary to protect Operational Technology Critical infrastructure (OTCI) have never been higher as the attack surface expands due to increased adoption of IP for business efficiency.  Operational technology security products and services aim to protect existing and evolving OT for industrial and commercial critical infrastructure systems.  Security and risk management leaders should gauge the market state and direction, and understand the types of OT security providers in the market.

        Fortinet developed and markets an OTCI environmental solution that is based upon the integration of Fortinet’s Security Fabric. This global responsibility entails Fortinet enabling the integration of a scalable technology to ensure the safety, protection, visibility, and control of all these critical infrastructure systems. Mr. Peters will discuss the digital and security transformation that has taken place due to IT/OT convergence that resulted in OT systems fusing with corporate IT systems.

        The audience will also get a cybersecurity architectural glimpse of how these systems are protected by Fortinet’s Security Fabric.

        In a modern conflict, the absence of war is not the same as peace; and a robust critical infrastructure is the first line of defence. The goal of an attacking nation may not be a country or its resources; it may just as well be the freedom to operate without interference. Thus, non-traditional operations with the goal to destabilize a nation’s resolve comprises a grey area between peace and war.

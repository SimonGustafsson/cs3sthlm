Who knows what is happening and how do we measure it? Exercise leader controls the overall exercise and he needs to make decisions during the exercise. Situation awareness Team's main role is to provide meaningful information to support his decision making. At the same time, other participants need meaningful feedback, so that they know, how are they doing in the different areas of the exercise.

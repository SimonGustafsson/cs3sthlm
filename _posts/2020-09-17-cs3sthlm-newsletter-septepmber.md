News on our upcoming event!

## CS3sthlm Virtual Summit of 2020!
The traditional CS3 Summit content, presentations, partner exhibitions and social events will be happening online on the [Hopin platform](https://hopin.to/events/cs3sthlm-2020). Instead of travelling to Stockholm, you can now participate in the CS3STHLM event from wherever you want. And to counter time zone differences and offer the best accessibility, you can as a ticket holder, either participate in the live event (CET Stockholm time zone Oct 21-22), or watch it later as VOD, Video on Demand.

## Tickets are for sale!
You can find the ticket here - [cs3sthlm.se](https://www.cs3sthlm.se/)

The ticket price is EUR 299 (including VAT 25%) and is not refundable. When buying tickets, you will have to register name and email on the Hopin platform. Then you will first receive a simple transaction receipt via Hopin, but you will also receive a detailed receipt via email from CS3STHLM within 24 hours.

## No trainings ☹
Sorry, but we could not manage to move the trainings into our virtual platform this year. 
 
## CS3sthlm Expo!
Yes, the Expo will be running in parallel on the platform during the CS3sthlm Summit Oct 21-22. Do visit our partners and check out their virtual exhibitions and sessions.

Hohoho!

When you read this Stockholm has passed the winter solstice (Mo 21 Dec 11.02 local time) and is finally going in the right direction! At least regarding daylight time, which with Sweden’s zero hours of visible sun should not be too hard to achieve. We are also near the holidays, which we would like to celebrate by giving you all a gift!

#### Ross Andersons’s presentation on the CS3STHLM YouTube channel!
The keynote presentation from CS3STHLM 2020 has been uploaded to our YouTube channel. The keynote was given by the inspirational Ross J Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, at the University of Cambridge. So we wish you all a Happy Hogmanay with this link to the presentation:

Many of you might have heard of the ongoing **SUNBURST/SOLORIGATE** incident.

Many of CS3sthlm alumni has been active in covering this, done in-depth analysis or helpt creating tools to do post mortem analysis. Here are some of them:

Fake base stations are often discussed as a threat for privacy of mobile phone users. However, many other devices, such as cars, lifts or industrial control systems (ICS), are increasingly using cellular connectivity. It makes some difficulties during penetration tests â€“ even though data sent through this communication channel might be exactly the same as in case of using WiFi network, its access is much more difficult. Most security guidelines ignore this topic. It turns out that fake BTS, so often presented in a bad light, can be also used to support security examination of this communication channel. The presentation will be based on practice - built testbed and conducted experiments. In addition, hardware requirements for such environment and legal aspects in diffrent jurisdictions will be discussed.

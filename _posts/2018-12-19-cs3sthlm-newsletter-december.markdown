Another holiday gift is that we already have opened the ticket sale for 2019 with a special **Earliest Bird** discount of 30 % on the two-day conference ticket.

Per request we have also added a number of vouchers, each valid for SEK 5.000kr, that later can be used for any CS3STHLM 2019 related cost like training, Expo or summit. If you still have budget to spend, that is!

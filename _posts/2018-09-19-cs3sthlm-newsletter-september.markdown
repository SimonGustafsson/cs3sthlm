#### Technical Training

This year we will offer six different trainings, to have something for all our participants. Some are technical deep dives, some are more theoretical or policy oriented. Here is some short info on the trainings:

* [Learn why honeypots]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/trainings/mikael-vingaard/) should be part of your toolbox to detect anomalies in your ICS network by taking Mikael Vingaards ICS honeypot class. This is a very hands-on class. Read an interview with Mike here: [/blog/mikael-vingaard](https://cs3sthlm.se/blog/mikael-vingaard/)
* [The Network ForensICS]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/trainings/erik-hjelmvik/) class is given for the 3rd time. Always sold out. Packed with network level examinations and protocol analysis, and you need to bring your computer.
* [The ISO/IEC 27019]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/trainings/stephan-beirer/) training can be very useful for those interested in policy level work for the oil/gas industry or electrical utility industry. Read an interview with Dr Beirer here â€¨ [/blog/dr-stephan-beirer](https://cs3sthlm.se/blog/dr-stephan-beirer/)
* [The ICS Pentest]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/trainings/arnaud-soullie/) is a hand-on class where you will learn to find errors and vulnerabilities in a ICS system. To add something little extra, the class also includes a capture-the-flag competition between the attendees.
* [ICS Strategic planning and war gaming]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/trainings/joe-slowik) is given by Joe Slowik of Dragos Inc to help you become better at defending your ICS systems.
* [Ben and Daniel]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/trainings/ben-daniel/) from Dragos will get you started with threat hunting in your ICS environment

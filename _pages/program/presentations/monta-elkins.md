If you think an air gap prevents communication out of and into your industrial control system, you are wrong.

We’ll be exploring various ways to send data across an air-gap in Industrial Control Systems and other environments, including a live demo.

Is it really possible to send data across an air-gap where no network has been connected? (No we’re not talking about wifi, bluetooth, wirelessHART etc.)

Can it be done without physical modification to your existing plant?

Can we get that paragon of virtue- a data diode -to pass information in both directions without physically touching it?

Find out.

#### Audience
Those who may have or consider an air-gap as part of their security.

#### Take Away
A better understanding of the history of jumping air-gaps and a new attack on data diodes.

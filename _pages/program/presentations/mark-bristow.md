This presentation will go through key DHS incident response efforts impacting critical infrastructure over time.  Using case studies and examples, we will detail root cause analysis of these incidents and provide recommendations for remediation.  We will cover major public incidents (Ukraine, Trition, BlacEnergy, Havex…..) as well as other less known incidents DHS has worked with significance.  The target audience is critical infrastructure asset owners/operators and ICS security personnel who will take away key insights derived from DHS’s role in defending US critical infrastructure.  This presentation will contain new (especially if something happens between now and then) content as well as historical content that articulates a particular defensive lesson learned.

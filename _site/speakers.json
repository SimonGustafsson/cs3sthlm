We’ve set up clients and a server for this bank using REAL physical machines and a REAL internet connection. All traffic on the network is captured to PCAP files by a SecurityOnion sensor. In the scenario this bank gets into lots of trouble with hackers and malware, such as:</p><ul>  <li>Defacement of the Bank’s web server (see zone-h mirror)</li>  <li>Backdoor infection through trojanized software</li>  <li>Spear phishing</li>  <li>Use of a popular RAT (njRAT) to access the victims machine and exfiltrate the wallet.dat files for Bitcoin and Litecoin</li>  <li>Infection with real malware (Nemucod, Miuref / Boaxxe and more)</li></ul><p>Class attendees will learn to analyze captured network traffic from these events in order to:</p><ul>  <li>Investigate web server compromises and defacements</li>  <li>Identify covert backdoors</li>  <li>Reassemble incoming emails and attachments</li>  <li>Detect and decode RAT/backdoor traffic</li>  <li>Detect malicious traffic without having to rely on blacklists, AV or third-party detection services</li></ul><h4 id=\"professional-software-included-free-of-charge\">Professional software included FREE of charge</h4><p>Each attendee will be provided with a free personal single user license of NetworkMiner Professional and CapLoader.

You might need to enable features such as ”AMD-V”, ”VT-x” or ”Hyper-V” in BIOS in order to run virtual machines in 64-bit mode. You might also need to turn off “Intel Trusted Execution” in BIOS. One way to verify that your laptop supports 64-bit virtualization is to download the SecurityOnion ISO and see if it boots up in VirtualBox.</p>"

			"description": "<p>Generation, storage, transport and distribution of electricity and gas are the most critical of all critical infrastructure processes supporting our daily life. As in every modern industry domain, energy supply is heavily dependent on industrial control systems (ICS) and the security of these systems. While many energy utilities implement an information security management system (ISMS) based on the ISO/IEC 27000 standard family, they often struggle with the inclusion of the ICS and OT domain, when they try to harmonize security management over their entire business scope. To fill this gap ISO/IEC 27019 <em>Information security controls for the energy utility industry</em> was developed. ISO/IEC 27019 is a sector specific control set for the process control system domain of the energy sector which is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002.</p><p>To supplement the generic controls of ISO/IEC 27019 with detailed technical security specifications for ICS systems, the German and Austrian energy operator associations BDEW and Oesterreichs Energie have published the BDEW/OE Whitepaper. The Whitepaper can be used during system procurement and defines security requirements for control and automation systems of the energy domain and their telecommunication infrastructure.</p><p>The workshop gives an introduction to the contents and practical application of ISO/IEC 27019 and the BDEW/OE Whitepaper. The following topics will be covered:</p><ul>  <li>Industrial control systems in the energy sector</li>  <li>Introduction to the ISO/IEC 27000 series</li>  <li>Overview of ISO/IEC 27019</li>  <li>Practical application of ISO/IEC 27019</li>  <li>ISO/IEC 27019 and European cyber security regulation</li>  <li>The BDEW/OE Whitepaper, a security procurement guideline for energy ICS</li></ul><p>The workshop will include a lecture, discussions and exercises.</p>"

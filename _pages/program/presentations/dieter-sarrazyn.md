This presentation aims at helping people setting up an internal "insider threat detection/prevention" program without looking at the big/expensive products out there. This presentation mainly shows how (sometimes simple) things and tricks can be used to tackle the insider threat within ICS environments. Before digging into the possible things to be done, a small recapitulation on what an insider is, is given. The DIY is meant to be done without (heavy) use of large and sometimes expensive toolsets and covers aspects like baselining environment and users. And what interesting set of information should be taken into account to increase detection ratio of insider threats (physical, network, system and user level). Preventing insider threats is influenced by network zoning, hardening, physical walkthroughs etc...

Free tooling such as arp detection, scanners, the FOSS project will be included in the presentation to indicate where these can be effectively used for threat detection/prevention.

All this will be with ICS environments and the inherent problems theirin in mind. A pragmatic approach will be shown perform insider threat detection/prevention within ICS without having to spend big money on it (except for time necessary to do/setup things).

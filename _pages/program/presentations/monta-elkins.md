Back in October 2018, “Bloomberg” recounted a Chinese supply-chain attack on Supermicro motherboards used in servers for Amazon, Apple, and more than 20 other companies.

Here is how I replicated it, on a Cisco firewall, with a shoestring budget, and how you can too.

This presentation will explain how I built and installed an implant chip on an industry-standard firewall, allowing the creation of privileged accounts, network access, and covert notification of successful compromise.

We’ll also discuss possible defenses and how to decide if you should be concerned about this class attack in your environment.

This talk will lead the audience through the chip selection process, the tools required to develop the attack (both hardware and software), and their use.

The techniques explained can be used on a variety of I.T. and O.T. equipment as well.

#### Target Audience, Expectations, and Key Takeaway: 
Audience: Security professional interested in supply chain “chipping” attacks of equipment

Audience takeaway will include the ease of creating “chipping” attacks on a small budget, the developmental steps, defences against such attacks, and understanding of why you likely don’t have to worry about them yet.

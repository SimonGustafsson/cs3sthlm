More news on our upcoming event!

## Keynote by world famous author Professor Ross Andersen!

This years keynote speaker is no other than the outstanding Ross Andersen from University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, UK. He is the author of the now classic book ”Security Engineering” first published in 2001, and is now revising the third edition.

## Welcome Reception on Tuesday evening Oct 20th!

Do not miss the Welcome Reception in the evening before the start of the Summit. There will be useful walk-throughs of our conference platform Hopin and our interactive tool Mentimeter, an interactive Quiz and more. We are also really proud to welcome back one of our favorite speakers, Jenny Radcliffe – The People Hacker!

## CS3STHLM 2020 Video on Demand!

Notable for this year is that the purchase of a ticket to the CS3STHLM 2020 Summit also gives you the possibility to watch the whole program by VoD. At first, directly from the Hopin platform during the time that the CS3 Summit is live, and later from our web site www.cs3sthlm.se. The presentations will not be available on YouTube as they usually are.   

### Tickets are for sale!
You can find the ticket here - [/cs3sthlm](https://www.cs3sthlm.se/)

The ticket price is EUR 299 (including VAT 25%) and is not refundable. When buying tickets, you will have to register name and email on the Hopin platform. Then you will first receive a simple transaction receipt via [Hopin](https://hopin.to/events/cs3sthlm-2020), but you will also receive a detailed receipt via email from CS3STHLM within 24 hours.

Best wishes from the CS3STHLM crew

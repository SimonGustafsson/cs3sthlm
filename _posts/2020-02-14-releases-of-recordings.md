We are working with releasing recordings from the 2019 conference. They
are added to the youtube channel as they gets finished (edited, mixed),
and after we receive the OK from the presenter. Videos are available at 
the following URL [https://www.youtube.com/cs3sthlm](https://www.youtube.com/cs3sthlm)

We have gotten some questions about the keynotes: Andy Greenberg and
Norsk Hydro Ransomware attack. The Hydro Ransomware attack was presented
with the condition that it would not be recorded and published. So if
you attended the conference you got an exclusive brefing which others
will miss. We agreed with Andy Greenberg to delay his Sandworm keynote,
since he is currently on a book tour. The recording of the Sandworm
keynote will be released later this year.

We will also add a movie archive at the cs3sthlm home page, from where
one can reach all recordings from previous cs3sthlm conferences. We will
announce it via another blog post when that work is finished!

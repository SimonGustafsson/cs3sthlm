We start by reviewing conditions for detectability and impact of data attacks targeting feedback control loops running over a field communication network. We investigate three different attack scenarios: Sensor attacks, actuator attacks, and coordinated actuator and sensor attacks. In particular, we highlight how a physical understanding of the controlled process can guide us in the allocation of counter measures and limit the possible impact of attacks.</p>"

		"description": "<p>Most Industrial Control System (ICS) networks require Incident Response (IR) procedures. Generally, these procedures fulfill regulatory requirements and do little to actually prepare the organization for handling an incident. Additionally, too many IR procedures relay on government programs (CERTS, committees, investigative boards). These programs may not provide the resource required and should not be considered a single point of response. This lecture will concentrate on concepts organizations should implement that decrease required resources for IR, arm responders, work with 3rd parties, and facilitate a return to operations.</p><p>This lecture will not cover general IR planning but rather focus on IR considerations within ICS. Network topologies, workflows, and approved actions differ from regular IT networks. Without understanding these differences, rash decisions during IR can have more negative impacts than the actual incident caused.</p><p>Key takeaways include action items an organization should consider when creating cybersecurity policies, IR procedures, and contract negotiations with 3rd party security vendors.</p><h4 id=\"learning-objectives\">Learning Objectives</h4><p>This session will arm participants with knowledge of common IR procedural shortfalls through case studies and examples from the field. This session will provide attendees with specific checklists for consideration when drafting IR procedures.

Most security guidelines ignore this topic. It turns out that fake BTS, so often presented in a bad light, can be also used to support security examination of this communication channel.

Future infrastructure organizations will need more data to operate efficiently and succeed in the brave new interconnected world. The diversity of new technologies and data will fuel more diversity in business opportunity. Everyone expects more OT, more IOT, and more IT - and all of it is supposed to be highly reliable and secure. These factors (and more) lead to a landscape shift for the industrial cybersecurity risk profile. In this session, hear ways to recognize the problems and gain some clarity on possible solutions through historic lessons, made up words, and practical front-line experience.</p>"

Siemens PD Solutions in Bergen, Norway recently relocated their lab, and developed this presentation in the hope that their security and optimization solutions specifically related to the network might be of interest to others.

In this research, we proposed an attack method that a PLC can attack other different vendors’ PLCs inside the net.If one PLC is infected, this PLC can scan the whole net to find all kinds of PLCs and send back the information back to a Command &amp;Control server. Then, once received the command from C&amp;C server, this infected PLC can do attacks to other different vendors’ PLCs. Like PLC Blaster, this malware can be spread inside the net.</p>"

		"description": "<p>Over the last decade, two instances of industrial control system (ICS) targeted malware successfully impacted operations. Most recently, CRASHOVERRIDE targeted a Ukrainian transmission substation in December of 2016. In both cases, attackers developed malware that crafted industrial protocol packets to manipulate control systems either by hijacking the legitimate master server or hooking the network stack. Defense against properly crafted packets presents a unique challenge as many existing approaches simply analyze the integrity of a single packet. This talk will focus on what stateful analysis is and how you can add it to your detection or hunting strategy to perform deep protocol analysis. We will cover the steps necessary to begin stateful analysis and dive into thresholds you might set for detection.</p>"

		"description": "<p>As ICS defense and detection matures, both defenders and products move increasingly away from traditional IOC approaches to newer, more robust models: anomaly detection, and threat behavioral analytics. While an appropriate, defense-in-depth position would work to integrate both approaches into a single defensive schema, scarce resources and funding constraints mean that organizations will need to choose one or the other for their monitoring and detection needs.</p><p>After providing an overview of both these approaches to threat detection, this presentation will then critically evaluate what these approaches enable from a defensive perspective as specifically required for ICS networks. The result will not just be a simple ‘product type’ comparison, but rather a robust investigation of the theoretical underpinnings of these approaches, and what they enable a defender to accomplish within the monitored network. Specific details will include completeness of coverage beyond ‘known bad’ items; ability to incorporate contextualization into alerting; and capability for detecting realistic threats in the ICS environment.</p><p>To provide appropriate context to the discussion, the approaches will be compared to ICS intrusion examples as a means of evaluating their efficacy and viability. By adopting a critical approach to this evaluation, ICS defense practitioners can gain insight into the true costs and benefits of anomaly detection and threat behavior analytics. The expected result of this presentation will be an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches with respect to the specific requirements for ICS defense, enabling attendees to evaluate relative to their own operational needs which approach works best for their environment.</p>"

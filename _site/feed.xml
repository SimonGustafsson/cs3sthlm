        <title>Submissions to the 2020 CFP</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;Submissions to the 2020 CFP&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the deadline of the 2020 CFP submission getting closer we have started to get some great submissions, but we are always looking for more content to get a good mix. We welcome presenters from the whole globe, and so far we have had people presenting from most continents, except Australia and the both poles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to have a good balance of policy and technical presentations since we want to have a mixed audience that needs to be exposed to all parts of the protection of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can always see some interesting examples of IIoT, incident response, successful deployment of new technology, new security research, low-level attacks, new models and methods to discover attacks. A full list of various areas and special topics of interest is included in the info PDF (see  below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several years we have had authors presenting - such as Kim Zetter, Andy Greenberg, Rob M Lee etc - and have had their books distributed to participants as part of their talks. If you are an author in this field, please consider contacting us to present and we will discuss possibilities for book signing, book distributions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the general information page on CFP here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/call-for-participation/&quot;&gt;/call-for-participation/&lt;/a&gt; and you find the PDF describing the CPF here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/assets/pdf/cs3sthlm-cfp-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;/cs3sthlm-cfp-2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt; and the submission page here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/assets/pdf/cs3sthlm-cfp-submission-form-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;/cs3sthlm-cfp-submission-form-2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the deadline is the 15th of March, and the e-mail address for submissions is cfp@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS3STHLM 2020 Theme Smarter!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cs3sthlm-heart.png&quot; class=&quot;blog-content-image-half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;CS3STHLM 2020 Theme Smarter!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-have-chosen-smarter-as-the-theme-for-the-2020-conference&quot;&gt;We have chosen &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smarter!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as the theme for the 2020 conference.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for this selection: “Smart” is used to describe many current things in the cyber industry – such as “SmartGrid”, “Smart Meters”, “Smart Cities” and “smart vehicles”. Smarter is also what the adversaries have become, finding more exotic vulnerabilities, and launching attacks built with increasing domain knowledge and sophistication. We, as people working in this profession, must be smarter, and we must design and implement smarter methods, tactics and solutions to be able to detect and protect against these attacks.   At the same time, we cannot forget that we live in a complicated world where “stupid” still is a highly viable option: “Admin/admin” is still used as login combinations! End-of-life firewalls are still in use! Old bugs are forever days as updates are not done! And separation of sensitive infrastructure from the rest of the business is still not done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We anticipate submissions from speaker candidates that will be describing new and smart solutions. We also expect presentations that analyses, or describes different attacks, on the stupid, on the broken, or even the smart.   No matter the mix of “smarter” or ”stupid” in presentations, trainings and hallway tracks, we know that all participants will be leaving CS3STHLM 2020 Smarter!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2019 Releases of Recordings</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;2019 Releases of Recordings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with releasing recordings from the 2019 conference. They
are added to the youtube channel as they gets finished (edited, mixed),
and after we receive the OK from the presenter. Videos are available at 
the following URL &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/cs3sthlm&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/cs3sthlm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have gotten some questions about the keynotes: Andy Greenberg and
Norsk Hydro Ransomware attack. The Hydro Ransomware attack was presented
with the condition that it would not be recorded and published. So if
you attended the conference you got an exclusive brefing which others
will miss. We agreed with Andy Greenberg to delay his Sandworm keynote,
since he is currently on a book tour. The recording of the Sandworm
keynote will be released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also add a movie archive at the cs3sthlm home page, from where
one can reach all recordings from previous cs3sthlm conferences. We will
announce it via another blog post when that work is finished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the CS3STHLM crew went to 36C3 in Leipzig at the end of December, and we learned the German phrase ”Guten Rutsch!”, to wish everyone a good start of the New Year! That event was also a good start-up for the work with the upcoming CS3STHLM of 2020; lots of interesting talks and new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now starting to publish all captured presentations from CS3STHLM 2019 on our YouTube channel: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/cs3sthlm&quot;&gt;youtube.com/cs3sthlm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sandworm: Lessons From the Ukrainian Cyberwar and Beyond</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/photos/andy-greenberg-sandworm.jpg&quot; class=&quot;blog-content-image-full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;Sandworm: Lessons From the Ukrainian Cyberwar and Beyond&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming CS3sthlm Summit (23-24 Oct 2019) in Stockholm, Sweden, attendees can listen to a keynote presentation by Wired senior writer Andy Greenberg. In his not yet released book, Sandworm, that will be distributed to the CS3 attendees, he tells a chilling story about identifying and tracking an elite team of agents bent on digital sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A detailed description of the book, made by the publisher, describes it as follows:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world’s largest businesses – from drug manufacturers to software developers to shipping companies. At the attack’s epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damage – the largest, most devastating cyberattack the world had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in history: a group known as &lt;strong&gt;Sandworm&lt;/strong&gt;. According to many different sources they working in the service of Russia’s military intelligence agency, and they represent a persistent, highly skilled force, one whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries. They target government and private sector, military and civilians alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keynote-at-cs3sthlm-on-thursday-oct-24th&quot;&gt;Keynote at CS3sthlm on Thursday Oct 24th&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-image blog-image-right&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/speakers/andy-greenberg.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Andy Greenbergs keynote at CS3sthlm on Thursday morning Oct 24th 2019 will he highlight the main lessons from the Ukrainian Cyberwar and beyond, inspired by experiences from his upcoming book “Sandworm - A new era of cyberwar and the hunt for the kremlin’s most dangerous hackers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Cox, Motherboard, who have read a preview copy of the book make a comment on Twitter: “God damn it’s gripping”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other comment that it’s a chilling, globe-spanning detective story, which considers the danger these type of cyberwarriors poses to national security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, foreign government manipulations comes into focus, which exposes the realities of todays global digital offensive, and the era where warfare ceases to be waged on the battlefield. It reveals how the line between digital and physical conflict, between wartime and peacetime, have begun to blur – with world-shaking implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees at the CS3sthlm Summit in Stockholm will receive a copy of the upcoming book Sandworm, before its release in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cs3sthlm---an-event-for-increased-cybersecurity-in-critical-infrastructure&quot;&gt;CS3sthlm - an event for increased cybersecurity in critical infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CS3sthlm is the premier annual international industrial cybersecurity event in Northern Europe. The sixth edition of the CS3sthlm Summit takes place in October 23-24 at Nalen in Stockholm, Sweden. The objectives of CS3sthlm is not only to present the latest development and trends from international experts and researchers, but also to establish a platform where people and organizations can share experience and knowledge among peers in order to better protect our civilization against cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS3STHLM Newsletter September</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Sweden it is still September for a couple of hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we will have presentations at multiple stages, so you have to cherry pick your favorites, or bring a colleague if you need to cover things in parallel! And as you can see below, it is really good to go to Stockholm already on Monday, even if the conference as such begins wednesday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;news-and-highlights&quot;&gt;News and highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;strong&gt;CS3sthlm app&lt;/strong&gt; from Appstore or Google Play to keep up to date with info before and during the CS3sthlm week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torstein Gimnes Are, Digital Marshall &amp;amp; CISO in Norsk Hydro will deliver &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday keynote&lt;/strong&gt; and describe how his team in their international corporation battled a major ransomware attack earlier this year. This presentation will give unique opportunities to listen and learn about global incident and crisis management at an organisation where ICS is the lifeblood of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday keynote&lt;/strong&gt; will be given by Andy Greenberg, award-winning senior writer for Wired magazine, where he covers security, privacy, information freedom, and hacker culture. His presentation is based on his upcoming book SANDWORM, about a mysterious series of cyberattacks and the team behind it. Targeting utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, and others, there is a lot to learn from Mr Greenbergs story. All CS3 Summit attendees will get a copy the book, and have possibilities to get it signed, two weeks before the official global release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency will be hosting a technical &lt;strong&gt;ICS-focused Capture the Flag challenge.&lt;/strong&gt; This CTF is designed to expose analysts to hunting across ICS networks for malicious behavior. With puzzles appropriate for both the beginner and the experienced analyst, all are invited to participate. Challenges include artifacts generated from IT/OT host forensic data, network data (from both bro logs and pcap), and OT equipment actively being exploited by a threat actor. &lt;strong&gt;The ICS CTF will be open daytime Monday and Tuesday.&lt;/strong&gt; Mail us at &lt;a href=&quot;info@cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;info@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/a&gt; and announce your participation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During Monday evening&lt;/strong&gt;, starting around 4 pm, our &lt;strong&gt;partner Kaspersky will host a KIPS game&lt;/strong&gt; where all our conference attendees can join. Enroll here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://invajo.com/event/thecs3sthlmsummitbyomnisiensab/kipscybersecuritysimulationatcs3sthlm&quot;&gt;KIPS registration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daytime Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; there will be the &lt;strong&gt;CS3sthlm Expo&lt;/strong&gt;, with both exhibition and speakers. Speakers include our partners and academic researchers from KTH and Linköping presenting the latest in their ICS related research. Enroll here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cs3sthlm-expo-oct-22nd-2019-registration-64817476818&quot;&gt;Expo registration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a few seats open at 2 o the 3 trainings: 1 day &lt;strong&gt;Hands-on threat modeling for ICS-OT&lt;/strong&gt; and 2 day &lt;strong&gt;Network ForensICS&lt;/strong&gt;. More info here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs3sthlm.se/program/trainings/&quot;&gt;/program/trainings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CS3 this year we will have multiple content going on at multiple stages. During &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday afternoon&lt;/strong&gt; at one stage we will have a large number of speakers presenting on cyber ranges, cyber exercise and training. A lot of examples will be based on the &lt;strong&gt;worlds largest red/blue team exercise LockedShields&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes from a busy CS3STHLM crew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;since-you-have-been-to-cs3sthlm-4sics-before-whats-your-impression&quot;&gt;Since you have been to CS3sthlm (4SICS) before, whats your impression?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was my first 4SICS and I’ve attended one more in 2016 before the name change. Great conference put on on by great people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-makes-this-area-protection-of-critical-infrastructure-so-interesting&quot;&gt;What makes this area, protection of critical infrastructure, so interesting?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its something that everyone depends on, every day to work. With out critical infrastructure working lots of things go wrong and its fun to work on something that every one depends on, and try to help secure it so that its there for them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-you-highlight-from-your-upcoming-presentationdemo-at-cs3sthlm-2019&quot;&gt;What can you highlight from your upcoming presentation/demo at CS3sthlm 2019?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My presentation will be about industrial radio insecurities with a major focus on the crane research that we released earlier in the year. No live demos this time, but more stories about what we did, how we did the research and how working with the vendors to solve a unique problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-current-state-of-cybersecurity-in-the-markets-where-your-operating-are-the-customers-well-aware-of-the-threats-do-they-have-good-protection-in-place&quot;&gt;What is the current state of cybersecurity in the markets where your operating? Are the customers well aware of the threats? Do they have good protection in place?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a vendor I don’t think I should answer this question as it may sound salesy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-see-in-the-ics-security-area--now-and-in-5-years&quot;&gt;What are the biggest challenges that you see in the ICS security area,- now and in 5 years?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With malware evolving and more and more systems coming online you’ll see more cross over from Internet markets coming onto ICS networks. Case in point is who would of thought ransomware would be bringing down factories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-you-looking-forward-to-with-this-years-cs3sthlm&quot;&gt;What are you looking forward to with this year’s CS3sthlm?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions with like minded individuals that also want to help solve some of the problems the world is facing in the age of internet security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-be-your-advice-to-our-readers-and-attendees&quot;&gt;What would be your advice to our readers and attendees?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage with the speakers, ask questions, get the most out of your time by making sure you have a true gasp of what they are presenting.&lt;/p&gt;

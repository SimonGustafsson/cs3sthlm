Having investigated 15+ latest advanced cyberattacks that were organized since 2015 against Ukrainian critical energy and transport infrastructure, media, financial institutions and governmental authorities and caused serious consequences - from data exfiltration and damaging computer infrastructure to blackouts - we deeply studied each step of the attacks in detail, determined the specifics of the attack and developed a range of behavioral patterns to identify targeted attacks.

With a help of ThreatSCALET -  Sequence of Cyber Attack Lifecycle Events - framework our team of researchers at ISSP Labs has discovered how attacks grew in complexity for just last 3 years, and how the attackers developed a mature supply chain of diverse competences and powerful capabilities.

    In this talk, we discuss how control theory can contribute to the analysis and design of secure cyber-physical systems. We start by reviewing conditions for detectability and impact of data attacks targeting feedback control loops running over a field communication network. We investigate three different attack scenarios: Sensor attacks, actuator attacks, and coordinated actuator and sensor attacks. In particular, we highlight how a physical understanding of the controlled process can guide us in the allocation of counter measures and limit the possible impact of attacks.

    There has been much speculation (not to mention exaggeration) over recent years about the fabled dark web. We’ve heard how this shady underworld is the refuge of the cyber criminal elite. That this is their “Wolf’s Lair,” where they gather to plot the breaching of businesses and the hacking of celebrities amongst other activities.

    #### This presentation will feature:

    * A definition of the dark web and how it differs from other sources of intelligence
    * Real-world examples of threat actor activities in dark marketplaces
    * Methods for uncovering emerging threats using dark web sources

    In this talk, we discuss how properties of the wireless medium and wireless devices can be utilized to enhance wireless security. We start with a short review of so-called physical-layer security techniques and then study intrusion detection at the physical layer in detail. We give examples for features that can be utilized, we discuss necessary conditions for a reliable detection performance and their impact on system parameters, and we analyze how packet filtering at the physical layer impacts the delay performance of the system.

    Preventive security controls, incident detection and timely response need to be coordinated for efficient security risk management. In this talk we first illustrate the benefits of this coordination through the example of precise time synchronization in power systems. We identify attack vectors, characterize their potential impact, and outline mitigation and detection schemes. We then present solutions for the resilient management of virtualized industrial controllers in edge clouds, with potential applications in smart grid control, UAVs and autonomous vehicular systems.

    Critical infrastructure security relies heavily on the security of the software and hardware that provide the basic execution platforms upon which various types of embedded controllers are implemented. Formal methods have been used, in the Cerces project and elsewhere, to formally prove the security of various types of hypervisors, microkernels, and separation kernel, based on relative simple models of the underlying hardware. The continuing stream of attacks on this hardware reveals that more refined microarchitectural models are needed. We present some recent work in this direction that is able to formally establish critical security properties, in the presence of some microarchitectural vulnerabilities.

    The momentum behind the convergence of historically distinct and separate domains illuminates the importance of seeking to implement robust security to protect highly valued assets that are In many instances delivering essential global services.

    The stakes in the game of outmaneuvering the adversary to protect Operational Technology Critical infrastructure (OTCI) have never been higher as the attack surface expands due to increased adoption of IP for business efficiency.  Operational technology security products and services aim to protect existing and evolving OT for industrial and commercial critical infrastructure systems.  Security and risk management leaders should gauge the market state and direction, and understand the types of OT security providers in the market.

    Fortinet developed and markets an OTCI environmental solution that is based upon the integration of Fortinet’s Security Fabric. This global responsibility entails Fortinet enabling the integration of a scalable technology to ensure the safety, protection, visibility, and control of all these critical infrastructure systems. Mr. Peters will discuss the digital and security transformation that has taken place due to IT/OT convergence that resulted in OT systems fusing with corporate IT systems.

    The audience will also get a cybersecurity architectural glimpse of how these systems are protected by Fortinet’s Security Fabric.

  description: |
    Most Industrial Control System (ICS) networks require Incident Response (IR) procedures. Generally, these procedures fulfill regulatory requirements and do little to actually prepare the organization for handling an incident. Additionally, too many IR procedures relay on government programs (CERTS, committees, investigative boards). These programs may not provide the resource required and should not be considered a single point of response. This lecture will concentrate on concepts organizations should implement that decrease required resources for IR, arm responders, work with 3rd parties, and facilitate a return to operations. 
    
    This lecture will not cover general IR planning but rather focus on IR considerations within ICS. Network topologies, workflows, and approved actions differ from regular IT networks. Without understanding these differences, rash decisions during IR can have more negative impacts than the actual incident caused.
    
    Key takeaways include action items an organization should consider when creating cybersecurity policies, IR procedures, and contract negotiations with 3rd party security vendors.
    
    #### Learning Objectives
    This session will arm participants with knowledge of common IR procedural shortfalls through case studies and examples from the field. This session will provide attendees with specific checklists for consideration when drafting IR procedures. This session will give attendees action items for enhancing existing IR procedures.

    #### Business Impact
    Planning around internal resources for incident handling is required within ICS environments and is especially important as the consequences of poor decisions can result in loss safety and even loss of life.

    “Network Segmentation” is a simple concept of 20 characters (space included). Doing it in practice and doing it right is much more difficult. Proper segmentation is much, much more than just adding a firewall.

    Over the last years we spend a lot of time and money on designing and implementing network segmentation for our multi-site IT and multi-site OT networks. Not only in technical solutions, but also in the required processes for maintaining the new environment. We made some (costly) mistakes and had to rethink our design based on physical and organizational boundaries.

    In this talk, we would like to present lessons-learned on the multi-million, multi-year project. It is not an official report-out, but a hands-on and practical presentation. We hope this talk will give the audience a feeling for the challenges of a proper segmentation program and help them to prevent some of the mistakes we made.

    #### The following questions will be answered
    
    * How did we convince Senior Management to allocate the budget
    * What underlying architecture did we choose and why?
    * What use cases did we envision and how did we work them out?
    * What design choices were made?
    * How did this work out in reality?
    * What did we learn?
    * What would we recommend?
    * What would we do differently?

    Operator stations are today one of the first systems/stations to interact with a distributed control system (DCS) or other industrial control systems. These operator stations often have some protection built in to restrict what the operator can do within the SCADA software and/or on the operating system itself.
        
    Within this presentation, some of the most (easily) discovered ways are shown/explained and how these can be (ab)used to gain a further foothold within the environment.
        
    The audience will learn more on the shortcomings of most of the operator jail solutions and what could be done to step up this game to secure this properly. Key takeaways obtained by the audience through this presentation is that you cannot trust operator jails in the thought that it properly protects attackers from gaining access to the operating system itself and thus potentially exploiting the whole DCS environment.

    Fake base stations are often discussed as a threat for privacy of mobile phone users. However, many other devices, such as cars, lifts or industrial control systems (ICS), are increasingly using cellular connectivity. It makes some difficulties during penetration tests – even though data sent through this communication channel might be exactly the same as in case of using WiFi network, its access is much more difficult. Most security guidelines ignore this topic. It turns out that fake BTS, so often presented in a bad light, can be also used to support security examination of this communication channel. The presentation will be based on practice - built testbed and conducted experiments. In addition, hardware requirements for such environment and legal aspects in diffrent jurisdictions will be discussed.

    Abstract: Innovative and disruptive technologies are enhancing and invading our traditional industrial business model. Future infrastructure organizations will need more data to operate efficiently and succeed in the brave new interconnected world. The diversity of new technologies and data will fuel more diversity in business opportunity. Everyone expects more OT, more IOT, and more IT - and all of it is supposed to be highly reliable and secure. These factors (and more) lead to a landscape shift for the industrial cybersecurity risk profile. In this session, hear ways to recognize the problems and gain some clarity on possible solutions through historic lessons, made up words, and practical front-line experience.

    The ICS lab is an critical resource, and not just for a solution provider like Siemens.  While the internal components of a lab may vary widely (witness the CS3STHLM ICS lab for example), the process of securing access to the lab network, while assuring availability and ease of use arguably has some common goals. Siemens PD Solutions in Bergen, Norway recently relocated their lab, and developed this presentation in the hope that their security and optimization solutions specifically related to the network might be of interest to others. Especially those with large, productive, multi-project, multi-customer lab environments.

    In the past few years, the attacks to industrial control systems(ICS) has increased year by year. Most of the attacks are exploit of the insecurity of ICS protocols like Stuxnet in 2010, Triton in 2017.
    
    In 2016, Ralf Spenneberg and et al give a presentation named PLC Blaster which demonstrates a worm lives and runs on Siemens S7-1200 PLCs, they use S7commplus protocol to transmit worms in PLCs. In this research, we proposed an attack method that a PLC can attack other different vendors’ PLCs inside the net.
    If one PLC is infected, this PLC can scan the whole net to find all kinds of PLCs and send back the information back to a Command &Control server. Then, once received the command from C&C server, this infected PLC can do attacks to other different vendors’ PLCs. Like PLC Blaster, this malware can be spread inside the net.

    If you think an air gap prevents communication out of and into your industrial control system, you are wrong.

    We’ll be exploring various ways to send data across an air-gap in Industrial Control Systems and other environments, including a live demo.

    Is it really possible to send data across an air-gap where no network has been connected? (No we’re not talking about wifi, bluetooth, wirelessHART etc.)

    Can it be done without physical modification to your existing plant?

    Can we get that paragon of virtue- a data diode -to pass information in both directions without physically touching it?

    Find out.

    #### Audience
    Those who may have or consider an air-gap as part of their security.

    #### Take Away
    A better understanding of the history of jumping air-gaps and a new attack on data diodes.

    Over the last decade, two instances of industrial control system (ICS) targeted malware successfully impacted operations. Most recently, CRASHOVERRIDE targeted a Ukrainian transmission substation in December of 2016. In both cases, attackers developed malware that crafted industrial protocol packets to manipulate control systems either by hijacking the legitimate master server or hooking the network stack. Defense against properly crafted packets presents a unique challenge as many existing approaches simply analyze the integrity of a single packet. This talk will focus on what stateful analysis is and how you can add it to your detection or hunting strategy to perform deep protocol analysis. We will cover the steps necessary to begin stateful analysis and dive into thresholds you might set for detection.

  description: |
    As ICS defense and detection matures, both defenders and products move increasingly away from traditional IOC approaches to newer, more robust models: anomaly detection, and threat behavioral analytics. While an appropriate, defense-in-depth position would work to integrate both approaches into a single defensive schema, scarce resources and funding constraints mean that organizations will need to choose one or the other for their monitoring and detection needs.
        
    After providing an overview of both these approaches to threat detection, this presentation will then critically evaluate what these approaches enable from a defensive perspective as specifically required for ICS networks. The result will not just be a simple ‘product type’ comparison, but rather a robust investigation of the theoretical underpinnings of these approaches, and what they enable a defender to accomplish within the monitored network. Specific details will include completeness of coverage beyond ‘known bad’ items; ability to incorporate contextualization into alerting; and capability for detecting realistic threats in the ICS environment.
    
    To provide appropriate context to the discussion, the approaches will be compared to ICS intrusion examples as a means of evaluating their efficacy and viability. By adopting a critical approach to this evaluation, ICS defense practitioners can gain insight into the true costs and benefits of anomaly detection and threat behavior analytics. The expected result of this presentation will be an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches with respect to the specific requirements for ICS defense, enabling attendees to evaluate relative to their own operational needs which approach works best for their environment.

    In a modern conflict, the absence of war is not the same as peace; and a robust critical infrastructure is the first line of defence. The goal of an attacking nation may not be a country or its resources; it may just as well be the freedom to operate without interference. Thus, non-traditional operations with the goal to destabilize a nation’s resolve comprises a grey area between peace and war.

    This presentation gauges the notion of risk in regards to proliferation of IoT attempting at being both comprehensive and yet exact. Risk is then tied to vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors typical for IoT. In conclusion, strategies for managing the described risks will be introduced. The presentation is based on a study conducted by Vidar Hedtjärn Swaling and Jessica Johansson.

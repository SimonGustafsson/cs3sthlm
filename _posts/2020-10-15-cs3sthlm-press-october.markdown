This years Summit on Cyber Security in Industrial Control Systems and Critical Infrastructure takes place in October 21-22 – but in cyberspace.

CS3STHLM 2020 is looking forward to a successful meeting for leading cyber security experts from around the world. This year the event will be virtual due to the pandemic situation.
 
>We are really excited to get the outstanding **Ross Andersen**, Professor of Security Engineering at University of Cambridge as our keynote speaker this year. He is a true pioneer in the Cyber Security field, and has just written the third edition of his textbook bible ”Security Engineering – A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems” which will be released in November, says Robert Malmgren, founder of CS3STHLM.

CS3STHLM also says welcome back to **Jenny Radcliffe** – the People Hacker, nominated for the UK Godmother of Cyber Security award this year! She will, during the Tuesday evening Welcome Reception, present ”Cunning Corona – on deception, scams and social engineering in a pandemic”. 

Notable for this year is that the purchase of a ticket to the CS3STHLM 2020 Summit also gives you the possibility to watch the whole program by **VoD, Video on Demand**. At first, directly from the event platform during the time that the CS3 Summit is live, and later from our web site [/cs3sthlm.se](https://cs3sthlm.se). The presentations will not be available on YouTube as they usually are.

The CS3STHLM Partner Expo, usually arranged the day before the CS3STHLM Summit, is now integrated into the two days of the Summit, and the conference participants can visit exhibitors in the platforms Expo section, or take part in partner sessions.
 
>The CS3STHLM Expo is not only a great opportunity to network and discuss the market field for interested parties, but will also consist of exciting demonstrations and presentations from researchers and vendors, says Erik Johansson from Omnisiens.

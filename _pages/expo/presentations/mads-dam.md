Critical infrastructure security relies heavily on the security of the software and hardware that provide the basic execution platforms upon which various types of embedded controllers are implemented. Formal methods have been used, in the Cerces project and elsewhere, to formally prove the security of various types of hypervisors, microkernels, and separation kernel, based on relative simple models of the underlying hardware. The continuing stream of attacks on this hardware reveals that more refined microarchitectural models are needed. We present some recent work in this direction that is able to formally establish critical security properties, in the presence of some microarchitectural vulnerabilities.

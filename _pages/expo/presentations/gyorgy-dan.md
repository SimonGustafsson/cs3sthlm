Preventive security controls, incident detection and timely response need to be coordinated for efficient security risk management. In this talk we first illustrate the benefits of this coordination through the example of precise time synchronization in power systems. We identify attack vectors, characterize their potential impact, and outline mitigation and detection schemes. We then present solutions for the resilient management of virtualized industrial controllers in edge clouds, with potential applications in smart grid control, UAVs and autonomous vehicular systems.

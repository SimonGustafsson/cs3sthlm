        <title>CS3STHLM Newsletter June 13th</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Outline of this short newsletter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CFP work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Announced speakers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical Trainings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early Bird tickets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Venue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conference Hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to share some info about the recent development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will carry on the tradition from when we where called 4SICS - to be a leading international conference on SCADA, ICS and critical infrastructure cyber security! We will have multiple stages with the best international speakers and trainers, having excellent social activities and provide hard-to-earn knowledge, no matter if it is deeply technical matters, sucessful solutions or policy briefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the program comittee, we are working with the submissions that we have received as the CFP closed. We have alot more submissions than available speaker slots! And still not all slots are for submitted proposals, but we have reserved some slots for invited speakers as well. Thus it is really hard to make the selection this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;announced-speakers&quot;&gt;Announced speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have announced a couple of speakers already, especially since they are related to investigations into the recently unveiled industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE malware:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Joe Slowik of Dragos Inc (US), who will speak on “Strategic Network Defense in ICS Environments”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ESET team (SK) who have a presentation on “Industroyer: biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have a special panel on the Ukraine 2016 event with detailed discussion, where both the ESET and Dragos specialists will attend. We plan to add more experts to this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More speakers will be announced in the weeks to come, including keynote speakers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-trainings&quot;&gt;Technical trainings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have a number of technical trainings related to network forenics, honeypots, hacking, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Erik Hjelmvik of Netresec (SE) will have a 2 day Network Forensic class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mikael Vingaard (DK) will have a 1 day Honeypot class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, with the addition of 2 day training classes, the pre-conference activity will start already on the 23rd of october!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-events&quot;&gt;Social Events&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have a welcome reception on the evening of the 24th and a conference dinner on the 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Malware that can knock out power grids discovered</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Slovakian Anti Virus company ESET have publicized information on malware especially targeted for automation in power grids. The malware is tied to an attack in Ukraine 2016. ESET have worked alongside researchers from another company, Dragos, to analyze the code. Investigators from ESET and Dragos will come to Cyber Security Summit CS3STHLM in Stockholm in October to present and discuss their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Lipovski, one of the researchers at ESET, states in Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The potential impact of malware like this is huge. It’s not restricted to Ukraine. The industrial hardware that the malware communicates with is used in critical infrastructure worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This malware is called the most dangerous code since Stuxnet, malware discovered in 2010 aimed specifically towards Iran’s nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Malmgren, owner and co-founder of CS3STHLM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;” The fact that this malware can be used and re-used in critical infrastructure everywhere makes it an enormous threat to non protected Industrial Control Systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS3STHLM takes place at Nalen in Stockholm October 24-26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;www.cs3sthlm.se&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information regarding the malware, please contact&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cyber Security Summit 4SICS Relaunches as CS3STHLM</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to a conflict of interest regarding the name SICS between the summit 4SICS and Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Omnisiens announces the fourth summit to be arranged under the new name CS3 STHLM. Three CS stand for Cyber Security, Control Systems and Critical Structures, and STHLM is an official acronym for Stockholm. CS3 STHLM takes place in Stockholm this October 24-26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top level cyber security experts from all over the world will gather again in the old concert venue Nalen in Stockholm for the internationally acclaimed summit. Owners of arranging company Omnisiens, Swedish cyber security experts Erik Johansson and Robert Malmgren, state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;-”We changed the name because we had to, but we are convinced our target group will find us, and that it won’t be such a big deal. Ticket sales are up and running, and we look forward to presenting yet another exciting mix of speakers and topics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest for the summit is expected to escalate while awareness of hacker attacks and vulnerabilities in IoT (Internet of Things), rises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are on sale with an early bird price until June 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facts-cs3sthlm&quot;&gt;FACTS CS3STHLM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS3STHLM is hosted by Omnisiens, owned by Swedish Cyber Security Experts Robert Malmgren; voted number one IT security specialist in Sweden in trade magazine Computer Sweden and Erik Johansson, PhD; Security Researcher, Advisor, and Contractor working at the intersection of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key note speakers previous years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2014 Stefan Lüders, Head of Computer Security at CERN&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2015 Kim Zetter, editor at Wired Magazine and author of the book Countdown to Zero Day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2016 Robert M Lee, SCADA expert who was one of the investigators of the attack on Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selected topics from previous years, among ca 12-20 per year:
In depth analysis of the attacks against Ukraine with Robert M Lee from Dragos and Anton Cherepanov together with Robert Lipovsky from anti virus company ESET who presented a thorough walk through of what is known about the virus ”Black Energy”, which was used against power companies in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet of Things; John Matherly, creator of Shodan, called the world’s most dangerous search engine leads a discussion of escalation of IoT with a number of the world’s leading experts on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackable pacemakers discussed by scientists Marie Moe and Eireann Leverett, they present weaknesses and possible threats against Moe’s own pacemaker. A kind of threat that led Dick Cheney, previous Vice President of The US, to discountct his pacemaker from the Internet to avoid being targeted by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit’s moderator is since the start Anne Marie Eklund Löwinder, AMEL, Head of Security at IIS, The Internet Foundation in Sweden, and one of seven crypto officers in the world with a key to the Internet root zone.&lt;/p&gt;

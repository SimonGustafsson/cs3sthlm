Finally some news about the 6th CS3STHLM summit! 

Our website is starting to be updated with information on the upcoming conference. A lot of new information has been published, and a lot more will be posted in the near future. Please check it out at this link.

For the Call For Participation, we got more than 65+ very good submissions from all over the planet. We have selected some submissions to start with in this year’s program. Please check out the first batch of topics and presenters listed here [speakers](https://cs3sthlm.se/program/speakers/) and here [presentations](https://cs3sthlm.se/program/presentations/) We will add presenters to the lists over time, as we also have a few slots reserved for invited speakers.

At this moment we have two trainings to chose from, but we hope to have even more very soon. The trainings that are set by today are **ICS/SCADA Penetration Testing** with Arnauld Souille and **ICS Network ForensICS** with Erik Hjelmvik. Information on available trainings at [/program/trainings](https://cs3sthlm.se/program/trainings/). If you already have bought a ticket to the CS3STHLM Summit, or if you just wish to participate in the training part, please contact us at [info@cs3sthlm.se](info@cs3sthlm.se) if you would like to add any training. **Discount 10% for COMBO tickets training + summit until end of July!**

Last year we had a success with our CS3STHLM Expo day held the day before the actual summit. The Expo day is free of charge and gave the attendees a chance to get useful knowledge through our partners and to participate in different activities. For the persons that like the hands-on approach to Cyber Security this is a good day to try out our ICS lab that will be filled with old and new ICS gadgets, many of them otherwise unavailable for testing.

Also – all video filmed presentations from CS3STHLM 2018 and earlier are now available on our YouTube channel:  [YouTube/cs3sthlm](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkD15o_9eJxUc9eeHtWSQ6Q)

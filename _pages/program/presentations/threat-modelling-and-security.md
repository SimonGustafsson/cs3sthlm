ENISA is continuing the work on communication network dependencies in industrial infrastructures, focusing in this case on ICS/SCADA systems and networks. The main objective is to provide insight into the communication network interdependencies currently present in industrial infrastructures and environments, mapping critical assets, assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures to apply.

In Sweden it is still September for a couple of hours!

This year we will have presentations at multiple stages, so you have to cherry pick your favorites, or bring a colleague if you need to cover things in parallel! And as you can see below, it is really good to go to Stockholm already on Monday, even if the conference as such begins wednesday! 

#### News and highlights
Download the **CS3sthlm app** from Appstore or Google Play to keep up to date with info before and during the CS3sthlm week.

Torstein Gimnes Are, Digital Marshall & CISO in Norsk Hydro will deliver **Wednesday keynote** and describe how his team in their international corporation battled a major ransomware attack earlier this year. This presentation will give unique opportunities to listen and learn about global incident and crisis management at an organisation where ICS is the lifeblood of the operation. 

**Thursday keynote** will be given by Andy Greenberg, award-winning senior writer for Wired magazine, where he covers security, privacy, information freedom, and hacker culture. His presentation is based on his upcoming book SANDWORM, about a mysterious series of cyberattacks and the team behind it. Targeting utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, and others, there is a lot to learn from Mr Greenbergs story. All CS3 Summit attendees will get a copy the book, and have possibilities to get it signed, two weeks before the official global release.

The DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency will be hosting a technical **ICS-focused Capture the Flag challenge.** This CTF is designed to expose analysts to hunting across ICS networks for malicious behavior. With puzzles appropriate for both the beginner and the experienced analyst, all are invited to participate. Challenges include artifacts generated from IT/OT host forensic data, network data (from both bro logs and pcap), and OT equipment actively being exploited by a threat actor. **The ICS CTF will be open daytime Monday and Tuesday.** Mail us at [info@cs3sthlm.se](info@cs3sthlm.se) and announce your participation!

**During Monday evening**, starting around 4 pm, our **partner Kaspersky will host a KIPS game** where all our conference attendees can join. Enroll here: [KIPS registration](http://invajo.com/event/thecs3sthlmsummitbyomnisiensab/kipscybersecuritysimulationatcs3sthlm)

**Daytime Tuesday** there will be the **CS3sthlm Expo**, with both exhibition and speakers. Speakers include our partners and academic researchers from KTH and Link√∂ping presenting the latest in their ICS related research. Enroll here: [Expo registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cs3sthlm-expo-oct-22nd-2019-registration-64817476818)

There are still a few seats open at 2 o the 3 trainings: 1 day **Hands-on threat modeling for ICS-OT** and 2 day **Network ForensICS**. More info here: [/program/cs3sthlm](https://www.cs3sthlm.se/program/trainings/)

At CS3 this year we will have multiple content going on at multiple stages. During **Wednesday afternoon** at one stage we will have a large number of speakers presenting on cyber ranges, cyber exercise and training. A lot of examples will be based on the **worlds largest red/blue team exercise LockedShields**.

Best wishes from a busy CS3STHLM crew!

In this talk I want to sketch out the threat landscape we might be facing with inter- connected infrastructure in smart cities in the near future and give an overview of what works and what doesnâ€˜t to tackle these security challenges.

Separating the hype from actual threats and thinking in development- and lifecycles that are sig- nificantly longer than those for our normal consumer electronics devices are a key part of this as well as bridging the language gap between automotive engineers and software developers.

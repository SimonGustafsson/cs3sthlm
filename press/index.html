    		<h3>Please Note</h3>

    		<p>Please note that the high profile of the summit means certain restrictions regarding photography, a photo pass does not guarantee access to the actual seminars. There will be dedicated press rooms for photo shoots and interviews, and we have staff on site that will help organize these for you.</p>

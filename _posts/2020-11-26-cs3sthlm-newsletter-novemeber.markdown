Greetings from a Stockholm that this time of year can easily be summarized with the color grey. We bring you good news on how to handle early winter and Corona restrictions! 

### CS3STHLM 2020 Video on Demand tickets are for sale!

The ticket price is **EUR 299** (including Swedish VAT 25%) and it gives you access to all presentations from the October event to watch whenever it suits you the best.

Furthermore, when buying the CS3STHLM 2020 VoD service you will be granted the purchase amount as a discount on next year’s Summit, be it physical or digital – or both!

The CS3STHLM 2020 presentations will **not** be available on YouTube as they usually are.   

### Training!

Sadly, during the CS3STHLM event this year we did not manage to arrange any trainings or workshops. Now we have been discussing to start an “ICS Gym” activity already the coming spring, and we would love to have some input from you on that issue. What type of training would you need to expand your knowledge? Are you experienced in something that others might need to learn? Every type of subject within the Cyber Security range, and in length from 20 minutes to 2 days are of interest for us. Please give us your thoughts on the whats and hows of knowledge sharing to [info@cs3sthlm](mailto:info@cs3sthlm.se).

Best wishes from the CS3STHLM crew

Full control!
The international focus on industrial control systems, whether it´s SCADA, local control or PLCs are high.

The hardware and software components that are the core of these systems, our most sensitive and critical infrastructure, are increasingly protected, and the management presents the new and great security solutions and -plans. Safe as the bank of England!

Or have we forgotten a back door? Do all the technicians, system owners and managers know the different systems that support the 
control systems how they are connected? How do you get into critical infrastructure through support systems? How can these systems affect and take down critical infrastructure? How do you get into a building with the help of the telephone system? These are the systems that often get the least attention, but that can be a way in which to create imbalances in our critical infrastructure 
or allow for unauthorized access.

In this presentation you will be presented for case studies and reviews showing how to utilize support systems in critical infrastructure.

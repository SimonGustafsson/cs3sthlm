ENISA will publish in the coming months  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT and recently launched the ENISA IoT Security Experts Group.

ENISA defines Internet of Things as an emerging concept describing a wide ecosystem where interconnected devices and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically to a context. Internet of Things is tightly bound to cyber-physical systems and in this respect is an enabler of Smart Infrastructures by enhancing their quality of service provisioning.

The upcoming report builds on previous work by ENISA, covering the areas of:
* Smart Homes
* Smart Cities and Intelligent Public Transport
* Smart Grids
* Smart Cars  
* Smart Airports
* eHealth and Smart Hospitals

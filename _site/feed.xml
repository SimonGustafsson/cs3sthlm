        <title>CS3STHLM Newsletter November 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings from a Stockholm that this time of year can easily be summarized with the color grey. We bring you good news on how to handle early winter and Corona restrictions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cs3sthlm-2020-video-on-demand-tickets-are-for-sale&quot;&gt;CS3STHLM 2020 Video on Demand tickets are for sale!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ticket price is &lt;strong&gt;EUR 299&lt;/strong&gt; (including Swedish VAT 25%) and it gives you access to all presentations from the October event to watch whenever it suits you the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when buying the CS3STHLM 2020 VoD service you will be granted the purchase amount as a discount on next year’s Summit, be it physical or digital – or both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CS3STHLM 2020 presentations will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be available on YouTube as they usually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;Training!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, during the CS3STHLM event this year we did not manage to arrange any trainings or workshops. Now we have been discussing to start an “ICS Gym” activity already the coming spring, and we would love to have some input from you on that issue. What type of training would you need to expand your knowledge? Are you experienced in something that others might need to learn? Every type of subject within the Cyber Security range, and in length from 20 minutes to 2 days are of interest for us. Please give us your thoughts on the whats and hows of knowledge sharing to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;info@cs3sthlm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes from the CS3STHLM crew&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank You!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CS3STHLM of 2020 is over, and a reflection is that the virtual event went even better than we could hope for. The basis of CS3STHLM is the content, and we are familliar with that part – but everything else in the event production was new to us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the organizing side of CS3STHLM, we would like to express our warmest gratitude to everyone involved in making this years Summit, Expo and Sessions such a success! We would like to give a big shoutout to all content providers and speakers, trainers - without you the event would not have been possible, and it was a honour to work with you! Special thanks goes out to our partners: Accenture Security, Darktrace, Kaspersky, Recorded Future, Sectra, sysctl, Trend Micro, Waterfall Security Solutions and also to the crews at Dynamic Duo, WeareBryssel, Scenteknik, Nikka systems, and all staff at Nalen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a content provider - we have already opened the &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cfp@cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;cfp@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/a&gt; for submissions to the 2021 event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have critics, comments or ideas for enhancements we would like to hear from you. Everything that can make CS3STHLM even better we would like to know! Mail us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;info@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ideas for topics, presenters, content, areas of special interest, things that earns a deep dive, please reach out to us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;info@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your input is important to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once again – thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS3STHLM seventh conference on Cyber Security</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This years Summit on Cyber Security in Industrial Control Systems and Critical Infrastructure takes place in October 21-22 – but in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS3STHLM 2020 is looking forward to a successful meeting for leading cyber security experts from around the world. This year the event will be virtual due to the pandemic situation.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are really excited to get the outstanding &lt;strong&gt;Ross Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of Security Engineering at University of Cambridge as our keynote speaker this year. He is a true pioneer in the Cyber Security field, and has just written the third edition of his textbook bible ”Security Engineering – A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems” which will be released in November, says Robert Malmgren, founder of CS3STHLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS3STHLM also says welcome back to &lt;strong&gt;Jenny Radcliffe&lt;/strong&gt; – the People Hacker, nominated for the UK Godmother of Cyber Security award this year! She will, during the Tuesday evening Welcome Reception, present ”Cunning Corona – on deception, scams and social engineering in a pandemic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable for this year is that the purchase of a ticket to the CS3STHLM 2020 Summit also gives you the possibility to watch the whole program by &lt;strong&gt;VoD, Video on Demand&lt;/strong&gt;. At first, directly from the event platform during the time that the CS3 Summit is live, and later from our web site &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;/cs3sthlm.se&lt;/a&gt;. The presentations will not be available on YouTube as they usually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CS3STHLM Partner Expo, usually arranged the day before the CS3STHLM Summit, is now integrated into the two days of the Summit, and the conference participants can visit exhibitors in the platforms Expo section, or take part in partner sessions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The CS3STHLM Expo is not only a great opportunity to network and discuss the market field for interested parties, but will also consist of exciting demonstrations and presentations from researchers and vendors, says Erik Johansson from Omnisiens.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;robert-malmgren-from-omnisiens&quot;&gt;Robert Malmgren from Omnisiens:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We had to adapt to the situation, and it took us a long time to find a way to move our event to a virtual platform without losing quality or content. Now we are proud and happy to once again announce an impressive line-up of speakers, covering a broad spectra of knowledge in the Cyber Security sphere. We have also brought with us the same production professionals that we usually work together with, to ensure quality and to try to transfer some of the CS3STHLM feeling onto the virtual stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new feature for CS3STHLM is that all material later will be available as VoD, Video on Demand, for all ticket holders. This is to make the content easily accessible at all times, compensating for the time zones differences around the globe.
 
The CS3STHLM Partner Expo, usually arranged the day before the CS3STHLM Summit, is now integrated into the two days of the Summit, and the conference participants can visit exhibitors in the platforms Expo section, or take part in partner sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS3STHLM Goes Virtual</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID situation is problematic for all. For a long time we waited to see if it would be possible to run CS3 in Nalen as we have done for the last 5 years. We have now, after many meetings and discussions, decided to go fully virtual for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional courses, presentations and social events will exist, but go online. We will add new formats and ideas, such as meetups, to the 2020 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details will be posted in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Locked Shields Sessions</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;The Locked Shields Sessions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LockedShields is the largest global cyber exercise. It is hosted by the NATO CCDCOE center in Tallinn, Estonia and runned once a year and involves 1000’s of people from many contries around the world. It is very technical, where a number of blue teams need to defend the society from highly sofisticated cyber attacks from a very large and advanced red team. The red team attacks telecom infrastructure, power utilities, water treatment plants, advanced cloud and virtualisation solutions, and the rest of the information infrastructure that make up a modern society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, people around the world received word that the the worlds largest red/blue team cybersecurity exercise, Locked Shields, will be cancled 2020 due to the current situation with Covid-19 all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very unfortunate situation for all involved - the people who have spent 1000’s of hours preparing the exercise, all the teams eager awaiting startex, and people wanting to evaluate the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation there are at least some nuggets to be found - we are releasing 7 videos on Locked Shields that was recorded at CS3 2019 at our special coverage of cyber exercise &amp;amp; Lock Shield. At that session  all different aspects of running a global, multi-team, highly technical cyber exercise were covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction and overview of the whole exercise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the The NATO CCDCOE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the green team build the large infrastructure that host all teams and all activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How red teams plan and perform their attacks,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How blue teams work when they are under large scale attacks from competent adversaries,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the yellow team, how some experts can be the magic glue and isolation between the blue and the white teams for factual and critical information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the white team is keeping track what is happening and keeping the scores&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the strategic decision making track was created and handled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed information on these presentations and videos can be found at the archived CS3sthlm site for 2019, please check out the wednesday track &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/2019/agenda/&quot;&gt;/2019/agenda/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Submissions to the 2020 CFP</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;Submissions to the 2020 CFP&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the deadline of the 2020 CFP submission getting closer we have started to get some great submissions, but we are always looking for more content to get a good mix. We welcome presenters from the whole globe, and so far we have had people presenting from most continents, except Australia and the both poles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to have a good balance of policy and technical presentations since we want to have a mixed audience that needs to be exposed to all parts of the protection of critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can always see some interesting examples of IIoT, incident response, successful deployment of new technology, new security research, low-level attacks, new models and methods to discover attacks. A full list of various areas and special topics of interest is included in the info PDF (see  below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several years we have had authors presenting - such as Kim Zetter, Andy Greenberg, Rob M Lee etc - and have had their books distributed to participants as part of their talks. If you are an author in this field, please consider contacting us to present and we will discuss possibilities for book signing, book distributions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the general information page on CFP here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/call-for-participation/&quot;&gt;/call-for-participation/&lt;/a&gt; and you find the PDF describing the CPF here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/assets/pdf/cs3sthlm-cfp-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;/cs3sthlm-cfp-2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt; and the submission page here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/assets/pdf/cs3sthlm-cfp-submission-form-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;/cs3sthlm-cfp-submission-form-2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the deadline is the 15th of March, and the e-mail address for submissions is cfp@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- CS3STHLM Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Second, we present ongoing work in evaluating the performance of PID-controllers under DoS attacks. The experiments are conducted in a recently developed virtual testbed, which is openly available. An important observation is that also benign physical processes may exhibit potentially dangerous oscillations under DoS attacks unless care is taken in the control implementation. An event-based PID-controller with adaptive gain shows promising performance under DoS attack.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>In the talk, we will discuss our research on the network communication of industrial devices that have Codesys Runtime installed on them. Codesys Runtime is an example of software designed to resolve the issue of industrial device unification and interaction.</p><p>Codesys Runtime installation has already been adapted for over 350 devices designed for all types of industrial applications. CoDeSys developers have made it easy for vendors to build Codesys Runtime into their devices to enable users of these devices to program them using the CoDeSys programming environment. As a result of this, the number of adapted devices is set to grow further.</p><p>A flaw or vulnerability identified in a core networking component on a device is highly likely to be reproduced on other devices, even though these devices may be based on completely different hardware. It should also be kept in mind that, since the software is designed for industrial applications, devices running it will be united into an integrated network infrastructure. And since no documentation on the protocol is available, monitoring network activity between devices is not an option. Putting these three factors together, we can see that the exploitation of a vulnerability in Codesys Runtime could lead to an attack on an integrated network of devices running Codesys Runtime, a situation not unlike a “Die Hard” scenario.</p><p>In the talk, we will analyze the proprietary network protocol, look at the fields used, describe the protocol’s functionality and how the packets received are handled on the client side. We will also discuss the difficulties that we faced in our research and demonstrate both the architecture­related vulnerabilities in the protocol itself and the vulnerabilities in the request handlers used by it.</p>",

The session will provide you with insights into areas of Governance, Network Security Monitoring, Vulnerability Management and Continuous Security Monitoring, all from the perspective of an Asset-Owner.</p><p>In the area of Governance management we will dissect the pros and cons of IEC62443, ISO27001 and CIS as a foundation for an ICS security strategy, demonstrate how to prioritize security measures and render existing security risks transparent to management for security risk acceptance. Based on this security strategy, we will motivate the importance of asset management as a foundation for network security monitoring, describe how to build an MAC Address based Asset Inventory based on existing network components and integrate it into a Security Information and Event Management System (SIEM). Effective network security monitoring requires asset owners to understand what sources of infection or attack on ICS exist, how threat groups exploit them and how they can be monitored.</p><p>Generally, it is not feasible to defend against all threats everywhere, however we will demonstrate how baselining can be used to make an existing attack surface transparent and prioritize network security monitoring efforts in a threat aware manner. We will show how baselining can be used as a foundation for hardening Firewalls and deriving monitoring scenarios and integrating them into a SIEM. In addition, we will point out the difference between shopping security in comparison to building security. Vulnerability management means identifying vulnerabilities present in the environment, understanding their impact for an attack surface and finding possible mitigations as alternatives to patching.</p><p>We will show how the concept of ICS in a Virtual Machine can be used for live vulnerability scanning and provide some practical examples on how to rank the criticality of vulnerabilities. Main focus is to point out common problems from an asset owner’s perspective and point towards easy solutions based on our experience “from the trenches”.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>The presentation will be geared towards asset­owners, primarily from the manufacturing sector. However, other industries may also benefit. I intend to present how we, as an asset­owner, are approaching the challenge of securing our Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). I will briefly discuss what an MES system is and why do most manufacturing industries need it.</p><p>An MES system bridges IT and OT networks ­­ it interfaces with ERP on the IT side and Automation layer (PLCs, etc.) on the OT side. And also interfaces with Laboratory and other systems at the same level. I will briefly go into the reasons why the MES needs to talk to both IT and OT. And how it is the air­gap myth­buster!</p><p>As an MES is exposed to the IT side, and hence indirectly to the Internet, it is critical we secure it. I will discuss how careful network segmentation will help in this cause.</p><p>OPC is a common protocol used by most MES systems for interfacing with various Automation systems. I will discuss our attempts at securing our legacy OPC­DA communication interfaces, and how we migrated to and are securing our current OPC­UA interfaces. Will go into security features afforded by the OPC­UA specification and how just moving to OPC­UA does not guarantee security.</p><p>In addition, I will present other security controls that may be deployed to increase security posture of a MES system.</p><p>Finally, I will end the presentation with the argument for absolute need for developing strong and verifiable disaster recovery plans (DR) and business continuity plans (BCP) for when MES goes down. And what would such a BCP typically comprise of.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>In most todays ICS networks, security testing is already being performed to know allweaknesses and issues. At least I hope that is the fact…. These tests are either run by the ICS owners themselves or by an trusted external party. However in a lot of occasions, security testing is performed in a too limitative scope and hence security issues often get overlooked because of this or potential drafted scenario’s to abuse the found weaknesses are incomplete and do not give a full picture. Next to that, a lot of talk is still focussed on testing industrial devices such as PLCs and other network components. Which is fine on its own but again the bigger picture is not looked at. In this presentation, a broader view is shown on how thorough security tests can be performed (without performing illegal actions) in an attempt to provide the ICS owners with a complete view on what their risks are. It is explained why you have to combine physical, logical and human elements within the different security tests you run and why it is sometimes better to take a step back instead of just plunging in and perform logical security testing. The different viewpoints on how you can perform testing to know your weakest elements are shown along with the different requirements to run testing from a particular viewpoint. Combinations of discovered weaknesses are then put together within realistic scenario’s. The advantages as well as pitfalls are explained of performing security testing this way using real­world experience examples.</p><p>The things mentioned within this presentation are all actions that can be done by ICS owners themselves, or should they decide in doing so by a third party, yet the ICS owners will then be able to follow along and understand what is going on instead of being left in the FUD zone.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>Patching known security vulnerabilities is one of the most essential task in any OT security program. Utilities having large number of patches to be applied in various cyber assets, use CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) metrics of the vulnerabilities to prioritize in applying patches. This prioritization however doesn’t serve well the purpose of patching at all times, particularly in OT industry; the reason being that CVSS has not been designed with OT security in mind. A low scored vulnerability that left unpatched can bring in high-risk to the OT environment. Environmental metrics have also similar challenges. Moreover, finding a single scoring system that fits every utility doesn’t seems to be realistic; at least in near future. Hence, there is clearly a need for a better approach to prioritize among various patches, that should take the cyber-physical impact on OT also into account.</p><p>This presentation illustrates a few examples of vulnerabilities and their respective CVSS score, in order to understand why these may fail to reveal the real impact to the ICS environment. Also, exhibits a possible better approach for prioritizing patch irrespective of the vendor provided score. For each asset in an OT ecosystem that has a specified functionality, the top priority would be to secure the functionality. For example, the functionality could be that a controller sending critical command to the field device or a HMI which displays the actual field data. This approach serves the purpose of securing the functionality of the OT system rather than focusing on confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p>",

The presentation will go through a scenario with an industry that has implemented many, if not almost all of the features, of an Industry 4.0 implementation; in which nothing is impossible and there is not a tin foil hat in sight. When the stage is set we will have a more adversarial point of view and go through the new different attack vectors that are introduced as well as how they can be exploited. Finally advice will be provided on how some of the new threats can be mitigated and what to do.</p><p>I define Industry 4.0 in three categories, how to connect data, how to process data and how to store data, all in big amounts. My perspective comes from starting my carrier as an system and automation engineer who worked extensively with optimization, building plant simulators and analyzing big amounts of data with neural networks before big data and machine learning were buzzwords, to later move to work with IT security at the Swedish CERT. This gives an unique view of how the industry has evolved and will evolve. This is combined with current work in IT security incidents, related to both ICS and administrative systems, giving a broad perspective of the attacks that are going on today. I will also look at statistical data today, and to what kind of systems and versions, are installed in each layer of the Purdue model.</p><p>Below are some of the different subjects that will be discussed during the presentation divided into the three main pillars om Industry 4.0</p><p>How to connect data</p><ul>  <li>How are ICS doing compared to OWASP IoT 2018?</li>  <li>Can unsigned live on internet?</li>  <li>Life cycle management with embedded system and what is hidden in there?</li>  <li>Web servers</li>  <li>Firmware</li>  <li>We are halfway between Y2K and Y2K38, whats next?</li></ul><p>How to process data</p><ul>  <li>Outdated operating systems, and the increase of that number with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008</li>  <li>DevOps in the world of ICS</li>  <li>The challenge of aggregation</li></ul><p>How to store data</p><ul>  <li>Can ICS move towards MongoDB, Hadoop and so forth?</li>  <li>HMI and store process data in the cloud</li>  <li>The unnoticed dependencies</li>  <li>New attack vectors such as speculative execution attacks and container break out</li></ul>",

		"description"	: "<p>Tactics, techniques, and procedures are the sophisticated intelligence information. Threat intelligence agencies using this approach attribute attacks to a specific “group”. This is also a valid approach to defend yourself against these attack groups. However, if you want to defend against an unknown attacker – especially in OT-infrastructures – it seems more suitable starting by the consequences of a cyber attack you want to avoid and the possible paths leading to it. Critical functions can be identified by applying the Consequence-driven Cyber-informed Engineering (CCE) method. Compromising specific devices or applications may provide an easy way to achieve the consequence the attacker is up to. This is demonstrated at a real test facility containing over 60 devices, which regulate a physical process.</p><p>This presentation illustrates the application of CCE for an attack on a facility. First, the goal of the attack is specified, which would be the sabotage of the facility in this case. After that, possible paths achieving this goal are determined. The easiest path in this case is an attack manipulating the communication between a HMI and PLC using a common but proprietary protocol. Finally, countermeasures from the IT security standards such as “IT-Grundschutz” and ISO/IEC 62443 are applied which hamper a successful attack.</p><p>Using the CCE method and a security standard, the presentation starts and ends on a high level. This is interesting for middle management, which want to improve their security. Furthermore, the technical illustration executing a possible attack is interesting for the appropriate audience, which is also present at the conference. During the work, a dissector in Wireshark for the protocol was implemented. Consequently, the communication between the devices can be illustrated in more detail explaining the performed attack. As a result of the technical and high level illustration, the contribution of the BSI outline a cyber attack for both groups.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>The session will propose an OT security engineering thought model which empowers automation engineers to take responsibility for their own systems’ security in a technically sound, systematic, and pragmatic way.</p><p>The thought model consists of four layers: The function layer includes analyzing and use case-based modelling of functional requirements an OT network and its elements need to fulfill. Proper operation of these use cases is taken as security objective. The risk layer takes the identified use cases and for derivation and evaluation of “abuse cases” forming threat scenarios. The third layer is about identifying security requirements, which are state of the art, compliant with necessary standards, and taking into account the organization’s existing processes. The uppermost layer deals with implementing these systematically derived security requirements.</p><p>Taking into account that in plant engineering and operation security requirements are never in focus, but always need to be wrapped around plant functionality and plant operators’ busy workdays, security engineering desperately needs to be efficient.</p><p>Also, when security by design is to be taken seriously, security engineering must be integrated in the existing plant engineering process, making use of tools and data formats engineers use anyway.</p><p>For these reasons, the presentation does not stop at introducing the thought model but shows how this thought model can be transferred into a machine-readable representation – a data model. The data model is not meant to take decisions away from automation engineers by boasting AI capabilities, but is designed to facilitate a more informed, smoother security engineering process.</p><p>The data model poses two advantages within the security engineering process:</p><p>First, it simplifies creating and visualizing network models and use cases, which serve as input for the outlined security engineering process.</p><p>Second, it sets the basis for (partly) automating the implementation of security solutions, by defining security characteristics of modelled entities which may result from the security engineering process. This also includes the opportunity to make configuration management “security-sensitive” by adding information like security requirements a certain configuration fulfills and risks a certain configuration mitigates.</p><p>The presentation outlines how existing tools may assist during the security engineering process: Asset discovery and inventory tools can provide the basis for network and use case modelling. Configuration management tools may help to roll out and maintain security-relevant configurations.</p><p>Still, many plant operators, integrators, and vendors are understandably reluctant to become dependable on such rather expensive tools.</p><p>Therefore, the presented data model aims at making use of efficiency gains that existing network inventory and configuration management tools promise without becoming too dependable on a certain tool vendor’s product. In order to achieve that, it makes use of well-established, non-proprietary description languages and data formats like AutomationML, OWL, and OPC UA. Thus, the proposed data model may serve as an open interface between existing, proprietary asset inventory and configuration management tools and the security engineering process.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>In industrial applications process control discipline involves monitoring and controlling of machinery, systems and physical processes to make sure that production processes are carried out efficiently, consistently and little variation. Monitoring is an integral part of plant operations and no OT environment is imaginable without local or control room HMIs and human operators. Increasingly, process industries take additional advantage of various optimization application for detection of abnormalities and early indicators of deterioration. In contrast, when it comes to supporting communication infrastructure (networks and end-points), they are frequently expected to be implement and configured in 110% reliable and secure way that no monitoring for deviations or breaches would be necessary. Ugh.</p><p>However, the purpose of this talk is not to discuss the terrible and unfair negligence of OT communication infrastructure when it comes to monitoring. Instead, we will use the case of “monitoring” function to help professionals from two distinct worlds, IT and OT, to realize their similarities beyond sharing hate for filling in timesheets. On the example of two distant jobs such as SOC analyst and Control Room operator, we will show how their jobs are fundamentally the same. Throughout the talk we will cover similarities and differences in key areas such as:</p><ul>  <li>Vocabulary,</li>  <li>SIEM vs. HMI applications,</li>  <li>Alarm configuration and response; alarm management,</li>  <li>Logging and log correlation; historian functions,</li>  <li>Types of anomalies/events/threats,</li>  <li>Event/incident root-cause analysis,</li>  <li>Incident response,</li>  <li>SOPs, etc.</li></ul><p>It is hopeful that by the end of the presentation, IT and OT professionals will develop a solid respect for each other the job functions and feel encouraged to discuss common matters.

		"description"	: "<h2 id=\"research-in-progress\">[Research in progress]</h2><p>Since 2011, capable and respected researchers have pronounced impending doom after documenting the tens of thousands of Internet-connected Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and automation systems.  Catastrophic failure of physical systems were postulated, along with crippling ransomware epidemics; after Mirai and ASIC-resistant cryptocurrencies hit the street, researchers also predicted Internet-connected ICS would be used to host DDoS botnets and crypto miners.  With tools like Shodan and Censys to find devices at scale, and open-source libraries to support communication with any ICS protocol imaginable, why haven’t we seen a golden age of scaled ICS attacks?</p><p>This talk explores the security economics arguments for why cybercriminals largely ignore ICS devices, and the coming changes to the industrial landscape that may shift criminal focus from IoT to ICS (or, more accurately, the changes that will blur the distinction between the two domains).  I will also discuss the usable security arguments that undergird users’ decisions to connect their ICS devices directly to the Internet.</p><p>I will start by presenting a longitudinal study of Internet-connected ICS.  We’ve fingerprinted and tracked thousands of individual devices over a four year period to identify user behaviours, track population stability, and infer patch cadence (to nobody’s surprise, there is not a lot of patching going on).  I’ll show that there is a large, stable, unpatched population of devices with open protocol ports, ripe for exploitation; this includes even the newest hardware and software combinations from reputable manufacturers.</p><p>Then, I’ll try to demonstrate that nobody really cares.  I’ll walk through static analysis of hundreds of gigabytes of malware samples, an assessment of hundreds of thousands of stateful honeypot interactions, and a search through 60 million hacker forum posts to show there is neither the interest in nor competence to attack these Internet-connected devices at-scale.  I’ll discuss the security economics argument for why cybercriminals largely ignore this domain, and how expected changes to the Industrial landscape in the immediate future could bring ICS to their attention.</p><p>In anticipation of the correct and inevitable objection that ICS devices should never be directly connected to the Internet, I’ll close with a discussion of usable security, looking at default configurations and user motivations in an effort to explain the current state of Internet-connected affairs and why we should only expect this Internet-connected population to grow.</p><h4 id=\"target-audience\">Target audience:</h4><p>This is a non-technical talk of interest (hopefully) to those including cybercrime in their threat model; specifically, vendors and security professionals concerned about how small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are going to handle Industry 4.0.  SMEs aren’t the only problem, but they’re the largest category of identifiable offenders.</p><h4 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key takeaways:</h4><ol>  <li>There is a large, stable, unpatched population of vulnerable, Internet-connected ICS devices.  This population is growing.  Without intervention, the growth rate is expected to increase based on pressures to make more devices connectable as we digitise manufacturing and industry.</li>  <li>The existing population size and heterogeneity, the cost to develop and deploy an attack, the difficulty in monetising an attack, and the existence of softer targets currently make Internet-connected ICS devices an unattractive target for large-scale attacks.</li>  <li>The growing Internet-connected ICS device population, predicted market dominance of a limited number of hardware and software frameworks, and improvements to IoT security blur the distinction between IoT and ICS from an attacker perspective, opening ICS devices to the types of scaled attacks we’ve seen against IoT.</li>  <li>Your threat model doesn’t need to include Mirai today, but it might tomorrow.</li></ol>",

		"description"	: "<p>As we respond to attacks on connected industries, control systems, and computer systems we have learned the value of digital forensics. The art of identifying an attack, collecting traces and recovering compromised data is an essential part of the cleanup process and evidence collection. A wellperformed forensic investigation also gives insights into how products can be improved upon, and how similar attacks can be more efficiently detected in the future.</p><p>The increased complexity of attacks, more creative obfuscation of malware, and highly motivated threat actors puts increasing demands on security researchers, and requires us to refine our forensic methods. We want to enable the potential of digitalization of our society while remaining robust with respect to cyber threats. According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, IT-related crimes grew almost tenfold in Sweden between 2006 and 2015, and the UK National Crime Agency and Strategic Cyber Industry Group reported in 2016 that cybercrime accounts for 53% of all reported crime in the UK. Ransomware attacks, for instance, can lead to costly outages or disrupt critical functions in society.</p><p>Digital forensics is a key area in which we have to be in the forefront. As a consequence of this, a newly formed initiative based in Linköping, Sweden has been formed in order to facilitate new developments in this area. Called the Digital Forensics Competence Center (DFCC), the aim is to focus efforts across industry, academia and governmental agencies toward better and more robust digital forensics. In addition to Sectra Communications, partners that make up the DFCC include two departments at Linköping University, the Swedish National Forensic Centre (NFC), the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE), Halmstad University, Ericsson, Saab, plus many others.</p><p>In my talk I will discuss why cooperation between the public, academic, and private sectors is key in building a connected society that is resilient against attacks on connected infrastructure. I will discuss the role of the DFCC and how it will benefit the ICS community. Next, what current trends in digital forensics can we identify? Specifically, how can improved forensic techniques be used to prevent and detect attacks on connected industries?</p><h4 id=\"target-audience\">Target audience</h4><p>Industry professionals who want to learn more about forensics.</p><p>The audience should expect to learn about new methods that can be applied in forensics.

		"description"	: "<p>The automobile industry is changing and new fields such as autonomous driving, battery enhancements and infrastructure or advanced mobility services are under development. As a side effect the interconnection of vehicles increases with numerous new protocols and technologies introduced to enable these scenarios, which also attract the attention of security researchers and hackers. Therefore, more focus on security practices is necessary.</p><p>One of these new technologies is Automotive Ethernet. It not only affects the in-vehicle network with enhanced bandwidth and protocol versatility, but also enables the connection of the vehicle to existing external network infrastructures. This can be accomplished by the Diagnostic over Internet Protocol (DoIP) which is used for diagnostic communication over the Onboard Diagnostic (OBD) interface.</p><p>Therefore potential unsafe or even unknown functionality is exposed to the outside world which, until now, was a private point to point connection between the diagnostic equipment and the vehicle. Moreover the diagnostic interface is commonly used to modify vehicles like enabling/disabling software features or update firmware. With an increasing proportion of software as a product features and at the same time raising attractiveness for malicious activities (e.g. fraud, attacks, manipulation) by attackers. The Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) are faced with new challenges in the domain of evidence preservation and reconciliation. Especially with the ISO21434 and UNECE on the horizon.</p><p>We examined possible scenarios that range from information gathering to malicious activities with focus on the vehicle and infrastructure. At the same time we approached the idea of what forensic evidence such activities might leave behind and how state-of-the-art technology helps preserving evidence. We therefore analysed the protocol specification and developed software according to our scenarios for evaluation. Furthermore, we studied existing forensic investigation approaches in the IT and SCADA domains and their feasibility with the DoIP protocol, as being the central point of communication with the in-vehicle network from outside the vehicle.</p><p>In this presentation we present our approach on the analysis of the protocol, the scenarios we derived and the tools we used for evaluation. This also includes the applicability check of the diagnostic interface for forensic investigation as well as discussion to provide these forensic investigations for court relevant incidents.</p>",

		"description"	: "<p>My presentation will touch on a few moral dilemmas that you face when you discover a critical vulnerability in ICS/SCADA environments. I will also discuss how my discovery was handled by the system supplier and how things could have played out differently. Another key take-away is how you as an asset owner can act to mitigate, and live with, a known serious vulnerability in your critical infrastructure. A problem that my customer and I had to face for over four years. The presentation will be of interest to suppliers, asset owners, and security researchers alike.</p><p>The story begins several years ago when I stumbled upon what I suspected was a remote authentication bypass in a component in a SCADA system. I came in very late in the project and was hired as a consultant to replace the IT representative of my customer at a system SAT, since he was going on parental leave. We did a few crude tests and verified that we could bypass authentication and asked the supplier to fix the problem. A few months later they came back with a new version that allegedly was flawless. I was asked to verify the fix and was handed the system on virtual machines.</p><p>Using passive methods (mainly Wireshark) I discovered that the problem was far worse than we initially suspected. The security architecture was something from the 80’s and I was able to reverse engineer the protocol and make the system hand over the keys to the kingdom… We went back with this information to the supplier and they tried to downplay the problem. It was hard to exploit and required deep technical skills etc… I got upset and wrote a 30 line POC in python that owned the system and sent them a screenshot.</p><p>My customer wanted to tell their colleagues within Swedish national critical infrastructure, and I was on my way to Stockholm to inform Svenska kraftnät’s security manager. That’s when the lawyers came. We discussed the handling of the information intensely over a few weeks, but finally my customer decided that the information was classified, and I had to cancel my trip.</p><p>Now my customer (where I also was employed a few years during this debacle) finally has received a new product to replace the broken system (not really a new product, just more lipstick on the same pig, but with a new fancy name). The problem seems like it is handled, and I think it is time to tell the story.</p><p>I will end my presentation with a demo of my tool for testing for this vulnerability. At least I hope to have something that could be called a tool at the time of the presentation, otherwise I’ll demo my POC code which is spectacular enough.</p><p>The presentation is not deeply technical but will sometimes drop down on the wire and take a cursory glance at protocols. The main focus is on disclosure, risk management, and how suppliers not should handle vulnerability reports. And, as a serial crowd pleaser, I will throw in a demonstration to boot.</p>",

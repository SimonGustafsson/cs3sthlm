## Thank you!

From the organizing side of CS3sthlm, we would like to express our warmest gratitude to everyone involved in making this years Summit, Expo, lab, trainings, and last but certainly not least the CTF such a success! We would like to give a big shoutout to all content providers, speakers, trainers - without you the event would not have been possible, and it was a honour to work with you! Special thanks goes out to our partners: Accenture Security, Bedriftsystemer AS, CyberX, Kaspersky, Nozomi Networks, Otorio, Recorded Future and sysctl, and also to the crews at Dynamic Duo, WeAreBryssel, Hell Production, Nikka systems, and all staff at Nalen.

The Locked Shields exercise network is set up every year to incorporate new threats that have been observed in the real world and new technologies that provide a challenge for the Blue Teams. The entire network for LS2019 comprised of more than 4500 virtual machines and 1100 networks. The playground included complex systems which branched out into the physical world, such as power distribution, 4G communications and marine traffic control.

Silver will talk about what the development process for the exercise looks like, who are the people involved and what kind of effort it takes. Using Locked Shields 2019 network as an example, Silver will go into details about what systems were in the Blue Team network and how they were set up to provide a challenge for the defending teams.

	"description": "<p>Since the first Embedded System was given a network interface, the Internet has been exploding with “Things” that have no Earthly business being there. The popular tool / website “Shodan” has risen to be the de-facto standard for cataloguing these devices, but what happens when Shodan fails?</p><p>Uptake’s Security Researchers have discovered a massive gap in Shodan’s coverage, and have developed several tools for not only quickly scanning the Internet yourself, but also several new methods for discovering and fingerprinting a surprising number of OT / SCADA devices on The Net.</p><p>Are some of them accidentally yours?</p><p>Let’s find out!</p>"

	"description": "<p>In the past few years, the attacks to industrial control systems(ICS) has increased year by year. Most of the attacks are exploit of the insecurity of ICS protocols like Stuxnet in 2010, Triton in 2017.</p><p>In 2016, Ralf Spenneberg and et al give a presentation named PLC Blaster which demonstrates a worm lives and runs on Siemens S7-1200 PLCs, they use S7commplus protocol to transmit worms in PLCs. In this research, we proposed an attack method that a PLC can attack other different vendors’ PLCs inside the net.</p><p>If one PLC is infected, this PLC can scan the whole net to find all kinds of PLCs and send back the information back to a Command &amp;Control server. Then, once received the command from C&amp;C server, this infected PLC can do attacks to other different vendors’ PLCs. Like PLC Blaster, this malware can be spread inside the net.</p>"

	"description": "<p>Operator stations are today one of the first systems/stations to interact with a distributed control system (DCS) or other industrial control systems. These operator stations often have some protection built in to restrict what the operator can do within the SCADA software and/or on the operating system itself.</p><p>Within this presentation, some of the most (easily) discovered ways are shown/explained and how these can be (ab)used to gain a further foothold within the environment.</p><p>The audience will learn more on the shortcomings of most of the operator jail solutions and what could be done to step up this game to secure this properly. Key takeaways obtained by the audience through this presentation is that you cannot trust operator jails in the thought that it properly protects attackers from gaining access to the operating system itself and thus potentially exploiting the whole DCS environment.</p>"

	"description": "<p>“Network Segmentation” is a simple concept of 20 characters (space included). Doing it in practice and doing it right is much more difficult. Proper segmentation is much, much more than just adding a firewall.</p><p>Over the last years we spend a lot of time and money on designing and implementing network segmentation for our multi-site IT and multi-site OT networks. Not only in technical solutions, but also in the required processes for maintaining the new environment. We made some (costly) mistakes and had to rethink our design based on physical and organizational boundaries.</p><p>In this talk, we would like to present lessons-learned on the multi-million, multi-year project. It is not an official report-out, but a hands-on and practical presentation. We hope this talk will give the audience a feeling for the challenges of a proper segmentation program and help them to prevent some of the mistakes we made.</p><h4 id=\"the-following-questions-will-be-answered\">The following questions will be answered</h4><ul>  <li>How did we convince Senior Management to allocate the budget</li>  <li>What underlying architecture did we choose and why?</li>  <li>What use cases did we envision and how did we work them out?</li>  <li>What design choices were made?</li>  <li>How did this work out in reality?</li>  <li>What did we learn?</li>  <li>What would we recommend?</li>  <li>What would we do differently?</li></ul>"

	"description": "<p>In this talk I want to sketch out the threat landscape we might be facing with inter- connected infrastructure in smart cities in the near future and give an overview of what works and what doesn‘t to tackle these security challenges.</p><p>Separating the hype from actual threats and thinking in development- and lifecycles that are sig- nificantly longer than those for our normal consumer electronics devices are a key part of this as well as bridging the language gap between automotive engineers and software developers.</p>"

	"description": "<p>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) as well as Operational Technology (OT) are under increased risks from cyber events.  Come learn how Cyber Informed Engineering is an evolving concept to use cyber risk in designing control systems and associated protection systems.</p><p>“Cyber risks to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) continue to evolve.  Whether it is the threat of ransomware taking a production system offline, or sophisticated malware targeting the safety critical components of your system.  Engineers have long designed systems to be resilient to a multitude of failure modes, and it is time that we started taking the lessons learned from cyber attacks against these systems into consideration during new system design, or legacy system retrofit.  This session will introduce this evolving concept and describe some of the standards and practices being developed and utilized.”</p>"

	"description": "<p>If you think an air gap prevents communication out of and into your industrial control system, you are wrong.</p><p>We’ll be exploring various ways to send data across an air-gap in Industrial Control Systems and other environments, including a live demo.</p><p>Is it really possible to send data across an air-gap where no network has been connected? (No we’re not talking about wifi, bluetooth, wirelessHART etc.)</p><p>Can it be done without physical modification to your existing plant?</p><p>Can we get that paragon of virtue- a data diode -to pass information in both directions without physically touching it?</p><p>Find out.</p><h4 id=\"audience\">Audience</h4><p>Those who may have or consider an air-gap as part of their security.</p><h4 id=\"take-away\">Take Away</h4><p>A better understanding of the history of jumping air-gaps and a new attack on data diodes.</p>"

	"description": "<p>Innovative and disruptive technologies are enhancing and invading our traditional industrial business model. Future infrastructure organizations will need more data to operate efficiently and succeed in the brave new interconnected world.</p><p>The diversity of new technologies and data will fuel more diversity in business opportunity. Everyone expects more OT, more IOT, and more IT - and all of it is supposed to be highly reliable and secure. These factors (and more) lead to a landscape shift for the industrial cybersecurity risk profile. In this session, hear ways to recognize the problems and gain some clarity on possible solutions through historic lessons, made up words, and practical front-line experience.</p>"

	"description": "The ICS lab is an critical resource, and not just for a solution provider like Siemens.  While the internal components of a lab may vary widely (witness the CS3STHLM ICS lab for example), the process of securing access to the lab network, while assuring availability and ease of use arguably has some common goals. Siemens PD Solutions in Bergen, Norway recently relocated their lab, and developed this presentation in the hope that their security and optimization solutions specifically related to the network might be of interest to others. Especially those with large, productive, multi-project, multi-customer lab environments."

   		   <p>These workshops/tutorials/trainings are the first ones announced. There will be more available in the weeks to come. Do not hessitate to register for one now, we will try to help you if you at a later stage want to switch to one of the later announced trainings.</p>

   		   <p>Due to the high level of interaction with trainers and complexity of the lab environment, most training classes have limited numbers of seats (15-20 seats). Each training class will be available on first come, first serve basis. We know that some training classes will be in high demand, so if you really want to get some specific training slot, be sure to reserve your seat as early as possible!</p>

In a modern conflict, the absence of war is not the same as peace; and a robust critical infrastructure is the first line of defence. The goal of an attacking nation may not be a country or its resources; it may just as well be the freedom to operate without interference. Thus, non-traditional operations with the goal to destabilize a nation’s resolve comprises a grey area between peace and war.

This presentation will leverage the previous 2-years of engagements from Dragos' Threat Operations Center (TOC) to examine ICS security trends, discuss the current threat landscape, and describe common actions organizations can take to better protect, identify, and respond to advanced adversary groups specifically targeting ICS. This seminar will list the most common challenges organizations face and use case studies to describe improvements we have helped our customers implement. Dragos recognizes the ICS community is strong and learning from each other on what works is the best path to a more secure global infrastructure.

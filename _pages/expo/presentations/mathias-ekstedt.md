This presentation will describe how attack simulations can be generated from IT system architecture models. Attack simulations can be seen as virtual penetration tests performed en masse on large-scale system architectures. The attack simulations identifies the easiest attack vector for an hypothesized antagonist and thus supports an effective approach identifying and evaluating various mitigation strategies before their actual implementation. The presentation illustrates this design approach describing a reference architecture for load-balancing of distributed renewable energy developed as part of a larger research project.

To show how seriously we take all parts of the CS3STHLM summit we have sent one team member to Carrara, Italy, in order to actually carve the prize for Best Presenter in white marble. If it turns out nicely you will be able to see, and maybe accept, the piece at CS3STHLM summit in October. If it fails you wonâ€™t. 

### WE WANT YOUR SUBMISSION FOR PRESENTATION OR WORKSHOP BY MAY 31

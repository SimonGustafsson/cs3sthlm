The first newsletter of the new year - and it is a short one!

* The CFP for CS3STHLM 2019 is now open. Please give us your presentations/topics for trainings or workshops before March 29. Also, if you have any suggestions for who you would like to see at the CS3STHLM 2019 summit - send us a mail to cfp@cs3sthlm.se
* You can buy tickets with Early Bird 20% discount until March 31. The ticket can later be combined with a ticket for training/workshop.
* More material from CS3STHLM 2018 is now published on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkD15o_9eJxUc9eeHtWSQ6Q)

Cordial greetings from the CS3STHLM crew!

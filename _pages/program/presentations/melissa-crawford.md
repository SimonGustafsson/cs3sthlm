The concept that we are in one country and the network stops at the border, is not the case for a Multinational Corporations. MNCs face the same typical challenges to industrial security as a regional facility, amplified over the cultural, language, legal and geographic boundaries of regional centers. As industrial facilities become further digitalized and enter Industry 4.0, the importance of security of the SCADA/ICS systems cannot be ignored. Many countries are recognizing this by implementing industrial control relevant laws to enforce cybersecurity standards and best practices. This means the multinational corporation must institute cost efficient strategies which encompass compliance with international standards and local regulations. 
 
The presentation highlights best practices for a successful development and roll out of industrial cybersecurity program based on our experience with MNCs. Unique challenges specific to MNCs are examined and explained. The work also describes the major phases of implementing a cybersecurity plan for a MNC across several regions, from asset identification and risk assessment, guideline/policy development, awareness training and rollout, monitoring center to governance and follow-up auditing, and built-in lifecycle protection measures.
 
Some region specific adjustments to the central program are presented and explained. The impact of reducing the attack surface after implementation of cybersecurity program at pilot plants is discussed.

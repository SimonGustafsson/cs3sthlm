This years Summit on Cyber Security in Industrial Control Systems and Critical Infrastructure takes place in October 21-22 – but in cyberspace.

CS3STHLM 2020 is looking forward to a successful meeting for leading cyber security experts from around the world. This year the event will be virtual due to the pandemic situation.
 
### Robert Malmgren from Omnisiens:

> We had to adapt to the situation, and it took us a long time to find a way to move our event to a virtual platform without losing quality or content. Now we are proud and happy to once again announce an impressive line-up of speakers, covering a broad spectra of knowledge in the Cyber Security sphere. We have also brought with us the same production professionals that we usually work together with, to ensure quality and to try to transfer some of the CS3STHLM feeling onto the virtual stage.

A new feature for CS3STHLM is that all material later will be available as VoD, Video on Demand, for all ticket holders. This is to make the content easily accessible at all times, compensating for the time zones differences around the globe.
 
The CS3STHLM Partner Expo, usually arranged the day before the CS3STHLM Summit, is now integrated into the two days of the Summit, and the conference participants can visit exhibitors in the platforms Expo section, or take part in partner sessions.


>The CS3STHLM Expo is not only a great opportunity to network and discuss the market field for interested parties, but will also consist of exciting demonstrations and presentations from researchers and vendors says Erik Johansson from Omnisiens.

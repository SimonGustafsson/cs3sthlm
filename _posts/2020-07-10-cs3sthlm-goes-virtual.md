The COVID situation is problematic for all. For a long time we waited to see if it would be possible to run CS3 in Nalen as we have done for the last 5 years. We have now, after many meetings and discussions, decided to go fully virtual for 2020.

The traditional courses, presentations and social events will exist, but go online. We will add new formats and ideas, such as meetups, to the 2020 edition.

More details will be posted in the near future.

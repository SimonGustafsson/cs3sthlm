		"description": "<p>In this talk, we discuss how control theory can contribute to the analysis and design of secure cyber-physical systems. We start by reviewing conditions for detectability and impact of data attacks targeting feedback control loops running over a field communication network. We investigate three different attack scenarios: Sensor attacks, actuator attacks, and coordinated actuator and sensor attacks. In particular, we highlight how a physical understanding of the controlled process can guide us in the allocation of counter measures and limit the possible impact of attacks.</p>"

Formal methods have been used, in the Cerces project and elsewhere, to formally prove the security of various types of hypervisors, microkernels, and separation kernel, based on relative simple models of the underlying hardware. The continuing stream of attacks on this hardware reveals that more refined microarchitectural models are needed. We present some recent work in this direction that is able to formally establish critical security properties, in the presence of some microarchitectural vulnerabilities.</p>"

Operational technology security products and services aim to protect existing and evolving OT for industrial and commercial critical infrastructure systems.  Security and risk management leaders should gauge the market state and direction, and understand the types of OT security providers in the market.</p><p>Fortinet developed and markets an OTCI environmental solution that is based upon the integration of Fortinet’s Security Fabric. This global responsibility entails Fortinet enabling the integration of a scalable technology to ensure the safety, protection, visibility, and control of all these critical infrastructure systems. Mr. Peters will discuss the digital and security transformation that has taken place due to IT/OT convergence that resulted in OT systems fusing with corporate IT systems.</p><p>The audience will also get a cybersecurity architectural glimpse of how these systems are protected by Fortinet’s Security Fabric.</p>"

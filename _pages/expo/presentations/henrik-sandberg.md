In this talk, we first give an overview of the MSB-sponsored project CERCES. The latest activities and results in the CERCES focus areas (embedded systems, wireless systems, communication networks, and resilient control) are reviewed. Second, we present ongoing work in evaluating the performance of PID-controllers under DoS attacks. The experiments are conducted in a recently developed virtual testbed, which is openly available. An important observation is that also benign physical processes may exhibit potentially dangerous oscillations under DoS attacks unless care is taken in the control implementation. An event-based PID-controller with adaptive gain shows promising performance under DoS attack.

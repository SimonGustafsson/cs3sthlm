We are announcing the CS3STHLM 2020 Call For Presentations, which of course also includes suggestions for Trainings and Workshops! Submission deadline is set on March 15, and notifications will start a month later. See the submission details at [cs3sthlm.se/call-for-participation/](https://www.cs3sthlm.se/call-for-participation/)

Please do take a moment to read our all-embracing Code of Conduct, it is formed as a vision test for reasons! You can find it on our web page under Practical Details.

We are closely watching the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) but it is at this point too soon to see how this will affect the situation in October. More news to come on this issue, but we have started to form a plan B. And a plan C.

The CS3STHLM 2020 Theme is Smarter! because our aim is that we all get smarter as a result of the event! [cs3sthlm.se/blog/cs3sthlm-2020-theme-smarter/](https://www.cs3sthlm.se/blog/cs3sthlm-2020-theme-smarter/)

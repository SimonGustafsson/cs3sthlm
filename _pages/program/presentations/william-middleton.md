The ICS lab is an critical resource, and not just for a solution provider like Siemens.  While the internal components of a lab may vary widely (witness the CS3STHLM ICS lab for example), the process of securing access to the lab network, while assuring availability and ease of use arguably has some common goals. Siemens PD Solutions in Bergen, Norway recently relocated their lab, and developed this presentation in the hope that their security and optimization solutions specifically related to the network might be of interest to others. Especially those with large, productive, multi-project, multi-customer lab environments.

GPS is used for many applications around the world. But they are vulnerable to attacks from jammers. EU-STRIKE3 measure and look on the risk we have. We will show what we found and give you guideline to increase your protection against jammers.

We also get more and more laws and regulations that we should use the GPS as a source of time.

Can we find a safe way forward?

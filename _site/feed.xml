        <title>Stephen J. Hilt - Trend Micro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a blog post with Stephen J. Hilt, a senior threat researcher at Trend Micro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;Stephen J. Hilt - Trend Micro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-your-name-where-do-you-work-and-what-is-your-profession&quot;&gt;What is your name, where do you work and what is your profession?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hilt, Trend Micro. I work as a Sr. Threat Researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;since-you-have-been-to-cs3sthlm-4sics-before-whats-your-impression&quot;&gt;Since you have been to CS3sthlm (4SICS) before, whats your impression?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was my first 4SICS and I’ve attended one more in 2016 before the name change. Great conference put on on by great people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-makes-this-area-protection-of-critical-infrastructure-so-interesting&quot;&gt;What makes this area, protection of critical infrastructure, so interesting?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its something that everyone depends on, every day to work. With out critical infrastructure working lots of things go wrong and its fun to work on something that every one depends on, and try to help secure it so that its there for them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-you-highlight-from-your-upcoming-presentationdemo-at-cs3sthlm-2019&quot;&gt;What can you highlight from your upcoming presentation/demo at CS3sthlm 2019?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My presentation will be about industrial radio insecurities with a major focus on the crane research that we released earlier in the year. No live demos this time, but more stories about what we did, how we did the research and how working with the vendors to solve a unique problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-current-state-of-cybersecurity-in-the-markets-where-your-operating-are-the-customers-well-aware-of-the-threats-do-they-have-good-protection-in-place&quot;&gt;What is the current state of cybersecurity in the markets where your operating? Are the customers well aware of the threats? Do they have good protection in place?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a vendor I don’t think I should answer this question as it may sound salesy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-see-in-the-ics-security-area--now-and-in-5-years&quot;&gt;What are the biggest challenges that you see in the ICS security area,- now and in 5 years?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With malware evolving and more and more systems coming online you’ll see more cross over from Internet markets coming onto ICS networks. Case in point is who would of thought ransomware would be bringing down factories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-you-looking-forward-to-with-this-years-cs3sthlm&quot;&gt;What are you looking forward to with this year’s CS3sthlm?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions with like minded individuals that also want to help solve some of the problems the world is facing in the age of internet security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-would-be-your-advice-to-our-readers-and-attendees&quot;&gt;What would be your advice to our readers and attendees?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage with the speakers, ask questions, get the most out of your time by making sure you have a true gasp of what they are presenting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally some news about the 6th CS3STHLM summit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our website is starting to be updated with information on the upcoming conference. A lot of new information has been published, and a lot more will be posted in the near future. Please check it out at this link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Call For Participation, we got more than 65+ very good submissions from all over the planet. We have selected some submissions to start with in this year’s program. Please check out the first batch of topics and presenters listed here &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/program/speakers/&quot;&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; and here &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/program/presentations/&quot;&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; We will add presenters to the lists over time, as we also have a few slots reserved for invited speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment we have two trainings to chose from, but we hope to have even more very soon. The trainings that are set by today are &lt;strong&gt;ICS/SCADA Penetration Testing&lt;/strong&gt; with Arnauld Souille and &lt;strong&gt;ICS Network ForensICS&lt;/strong&gt; with Erik Hjelmvik. Information on available trainings at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs3sthlm.se/program/trainings/&quot;&gt;/program/trainings&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have bought a ticket to the CS3STHLM Summit, or if you just wish to participate in the training part, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;info@cs3sthlm.se&quot;&gt;info@cs3sthlm.se&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to add any training. &lt;strong&gt;Discount 10% for COMBO tickets training + summit until end of July!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we had a success with our CS3STHLM Expo day held the day before the actual summit. The Expo day is free of charge and gave the attendees a chance to get useful knowledge through our partners and to participate in different activities. For the persons that like the hands-on approach to Cyber Security this is a good day to try out our ICS lab that will be filled with old and new ICS gadgets, many of them otherwise unavailable for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;appreciated-expansion-of-acclaimed-cyber-security-conference&quot;&gt;APPRECIATED EXPANSION OF ACCLAIMED CYBER SECURITY CONFERENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This years edition of CS3STHLM presented an Expo Day as well as an extended interaction between participants and panelists. 10 students from Norway and Sweden were invited to take part of a challenge which resulted in two students from Norway and Sweden winning a reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first conference day founders Robert Malmgren and Erik Johansson are pleased to state that the years conference is the most successful so far, both in attendance and format. The new expo day added a welcome meeting arena for businesses, legislators and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day of the summit will open with Key Note Patrick Miller (US) and his presentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-technology-trajectory-running-with-scissors&quot;&gt;Industrial Technology Trajectory: Running With Scissors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovative and disruptive technologies are enhancing and invading our traditional industrial business model. Future infrastructure organizations will need more data to operate efficiently and succeed in the brave new interconnected world. The diversity of new technologies and data will fuel more diversity in business opportunity. Everyone expects more OT, more IOT, and more IT - and all of it is supposed to be highly reliable and secure. These factors (and more) lead to a landscape shift for the industrial cybersecurity risk profile. In this session, hear ways to recognize the problems and gain some clarity on possible solutions through historic lessons, made up words, and practical front-line experience.a&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS3STHLM App and Honey Pot Competition</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;cs3sthlm-launches-conference-app&quot;&gt;CS3STHLM LAUNCHES CONFERENCE APP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the conference opens for the 5th consecutive year participants can download an app with agenda, presentations of speakers, and the possibility of partaking in polls, give direct response to seminars, lectures and questions asked from stage. This also means a channel for newsflashes, changes in the program and messages from conference management. You find the app in usual app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;honey-pot-chase-competition&quot;&gt;HONEY POT CHASE COMPETITION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mikael Vingaard, (DK), invites all participants to a competition to find Honey Pots: Can you spot the honey-pot(s) @ the ICS Lab? - challenge yourself and find the honey-pot(s) hidden - submit your findings and win a prize!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spot-the-honey-pot---the-rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;“Spot the Honey-pot” - The rules of engagement;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition starts 24.oct Wednesday at 10.00 am and ends Thursday at 14.30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner will be announced during the closing session, and need to be in the audience during the closing session.
Use whatever tools (e.g. telnet, nmap, PLCscan etc) to find the honeypot(s), we have placed @ the ICS Lab industrial networks!
Be a good ICS neighbor, don’t try to change the configuration on anything, DDOS’ing or otherwise break stuff on purpose - or in any way make the competition harder for your fellow contesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may work together as a team, but only one prize is rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things interesting, we will change the Honeypot environment, during the whole CS3sthlm conference.
There might be many honey-pots hidden - and not only on one single ICS networks - so do remember to look at ICS_Lab network 1 to 4.
In case, that several contesters gets the same (correct) reply - there will be a drawing, to find the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To participate, do send an email with the following to stockholm@defenica.com before Thursday 14.30 :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Your name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) time of your research - aka. the date+ Hour as we will dynamically change the honeypot(s) during CS3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C) IP’s of the honeypots you have spotted - do remember to write on what ICS_LAB network it was found, e.g. IP x.x.x.x on ICS network 4 + IP z.y.y.y on ICS network 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPDR stuff; the information collected during “Spot the Honeypot” will only be used for this competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May the best honey-pot spotter win :-)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CS3STHLM fifth conference on industrial cyber security</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;CS3STHLM FIFTH CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL CYBER SECURITY ADDRESSING THREATS AND POSSIBILITIES IN A GROWING DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tickets almost sold out, arranging Omnisiens are looking forward to a successful meeting for leading cyber security experts from around the world. CS3STHLM takes place in Nalen, Stockholm, October 22-25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably first day keynote speaker, Marty Edwards (US), has had to cancel due to personal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizer Robert Malmgren from Omnisiens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”- It’s unfortunate that Marty Edwards had to cancel at such short notice, but we feel confident that our replacement will complement our diverse agenda.” New keynote speaker for the first day will be Mark Bristow (US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth edition of the acclaimed conference includes a formidable list of renowned speakers, and in addition to seminars and workshops there will be an complementary expo day on Tuesday the 23rd for companies and organisations within this field. The Expo day is free of charge but entrance require registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erik Johansson from Omnisiens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”- The Expo is not only a great opportunity to network and discuss the market field for interested parties, but will also consist of exciting demonstrations and presentation from researchers and vendors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlights from the program:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ola Hermansson - Technical Operations Manager</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a blog post with Ola Hermansson, one of the guys in our great crew.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-title&quot; itemprop=&quot;name headline&quot;&gt;Ola Hermansson - Technical Operations Manager&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-your-name-where-do-you-work-and-what-is-your-profession&quot;&gt;What is your name, where do you work and what is your profession?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Ola Hermansson. I’m an audio engineer by trade, and work with stage craft and engineering on TV-productions, concerts and corporate events. Where I work? Everywhere…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;for-how-many-years-have-you-been-involved-in-this-conference&quot;&gt;For how many years have you been involved in this conference?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, “As time goes by” (like Sam sung in Casablanca). This years conference is my fourth i believe. My first CS3 (then 4SICS)-experience was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-did-you-get-involved-in-this-both-with-your-profession-and-with-this-event&quot;&gt;How did you get involved in this, both with your profession and with this event?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My profession is a life-long love story (the cliché “I started out as a child” comes in handy…). Regarding me getting involved with the good people at CS3, I think it was my colleague Anders Hagström that was given the opportunity to work with the event, and asked me to join the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-your-role-during-the-conference&quot;&gt;What is your role during the conference?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage and run the technical operations when we’re “live” (so to speak). My main target is to keep the show running smooth (out of a technical perspective) and keeping the keynote speakers happy, giving them the best possible platform to perform on stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-normaly-travel-the-world-with-rock-stars-and-tv-celebrities-so-this-must-be-the-complete-contrast-or&quot;&gt;You normaly travel the world with rock stars and TV celebrities, so this must be the complete contrast, or?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to think quite the opposite. The tools we use during CS3 is much the same as we use in a TV- or concert-production. Except the rock stars are PhD’s and the TV-cameras are fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-it-a-marathon-race-a-100-meter-race-or-something-else-to-do-this-kind-of-job&quot;&gt;Is it a marathon race, a 100 meter race, or something else to do this kind of job?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of depends of your position in a production. In this particular case, I come into play when much of the “marathon-like” work is done. For me it’s more like a 100 meter race, for one intense week. Of course there’s a lot of pre production on the technical side of things as well, but the intense part of the work takes place the last days just before a production (when we set things up) and during the show. One cool thing about working live production, is that you really only get one chance to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-see&quot;&gt;What is the biggest challenges that you see?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating people’s expectations year after year, that’s a big challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-your-best-memories-from-the-previous-conferences&quot;&gt;What is your best memories from the previous conferences?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, Lot’s off goodies - but Jenny Radcliffe’s “Tales of a people Hacker” in 2017 was really intriguing. Also, for a techie like me, the GeekLounge in the basement is a really cool place as well (even though the technical level of the stuff going down there is kind of above my pay-grade :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-you-look-forward-to-with-this-years-event&quot;&gt;What do you look forward to with this years event?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at Nalen (the Venue) is always super cosy, I really like that place. This year will also feature an expo (taking place the day before the actual conference starts) - this means some new challenges for us production-wise, that I’m kind of looking forward to dealing with. It’s gonna be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;any-last-words-of-advice-to-our-readers-and-the-attendees&quot;&gt;Any last words of advice to our readers and the attendees?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Buy a ticket. Show up. Stay geek?&lt;/p&gt;

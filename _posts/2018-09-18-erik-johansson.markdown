Behind the scenes: Erik Johansson, CS3sthlm organizer

#### What is your name, where do you work and what is your profession?

My name is Erik Johansson. I have a research background and work to increase industrial cyber security, with focus on critical infrastructure protection. However, I often see myself as an Industrial Cyber Security Evangelist. 

Since I have found that most often the root cause behind technical weaknesses comes down to changing organisations mindset by educating and training the them!


#### For how many years have you been involved in this conference?

Well the ideas for this conference started like a decade ago, when Robert and myself annually was traveling to US for the S4 conference in Miami. We where surprised and somewhat disappointed that Europe lacked a good conference focusing on Industrial Cyber Security… The ones that existed was too commercial and lacked the technical depth!


#### How did you get involved in this, both with your profession and with this event?

By accident… :) 

Having a background from work at a nuclear power plant I started my research at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) with focus on the security challenges for nuclear power plants migrating from analog to digital (programmable electronics). However, after a while I found that the measuring and evaluation of security level was far more complicated than I initially had thought… and realized that it was more a cultural problem because we are only human. :)

During my earlier years in the industry I ran into Robert Malmgren - by far the best IT-security guy I ever met since he did not only understand the bits and bites but could also understand the business perspective - and the lack of human understanding of the complexity.

#### What is your role during the conference?

As the co-founder, together with Robert Malmgren, I’m a part of the program committee and involved in the evaluation of the submitted papers, selecting partners and overall discussion with industry

#### Running a big event like CS3sthlm is different from your day-to-day work, or?

Yes, definitely different.  It's an expensive ”hobby" - that takes huge amount of our spare time - away from our friends and family - and every year we’re  worn out.  However, it’s also super interesting to get to know the most clever people on this planet… :)



#### Is it a marathon race, a 100 meter race, is it cat herding or something else to do this kind of job?

Good question. It’s really a mix. It’s a Marathon in the way that the planning and preparations starts almost direct after the last one - but sometimes its more like a 100 meter race - like when we get 50 submissions that needs to be evaluated. Or the final program is getting in place… and yes we are exhausted after each event.


#### Why should I go ?

If you’re working in critical infrastructure, as manager or operational, and would like to learn more about current threats, incidents, vulnerabilities and experiences as well as success stories…
…and to network among peers that inspire and share valuable knowledge!


#### What is the biggest challenges that you see?

The biggest challenges for the industry or the conference?

Industry have a huge challenge to get a mature security culture in place

The challenges from a conference perspective is to reach out and bridge the gap between top-level decision makers and technical experts as well as the gap between IT and OT departments.


#### What is your best memories from the previous conferences?


Hard to tell which is the best - there are so many good memories. 

A couple of special moments:

When Ruben Santamarta (IOACTIVE) did a live hacking of a SATCOM equipment on stage 
or when we had, the only Swedish Astronaut, Fuglesang as the evening speaker!


#### What do you look forward to with this years event?

I’m really exited for this our fifth anniversary which has been extended with an EXPO!


#### Any last words of advice to our readers and the attendees?

Arrive early! Participate and interact with the vendors at the EXPO. Moreover, take the opportunity to visit and take a close look at the ICS lab and all equipment

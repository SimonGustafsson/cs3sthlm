The NIS Directive is the first piece of EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity. It provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU. In the context of the NIS Directive, ENISA is assisting Member States and the European Commission by providing expertise and advice, as well as developing and facilitating the exchange of good practices.

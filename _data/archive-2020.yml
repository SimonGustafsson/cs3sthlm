      bio: John is the author of SHODAN also known as "World's most Dangerous Search Engine", which have huge relevance for SCADA and ICS security. John has been described as an Internet cartographer. He his famous as the founder of Shodan, the world’s first search engine for the Internet-connected devices (read more here). For the past years, he has been featured in the news on BBC News, CNBC, CNN Money, Bloomberg, Washington Post, Forbes, Wired and many others. It was in 2009, his hobby project "the Shodan search engine" was unveiled on Twitter and within hours the website received a lot of attention due to the unexpected discoveries that people made. Printers, webcams, power plants and more, many of them unprotected or minimally protected, were found over time and the revelations have changed the way security and privacy on the Internet is perceived. Shodan is already seeing TVs, cell phones, traffic lights, industrial controls, infrastructure plants and various home appliances pop-up in the search results. And more of these “Internet of Things” are added each day as the world is becoming more connected.

      bio: Ruben has over 10 years experience working for the security industry in different roles such as malware analysis or exploit development. Ruben has found dozens of vulnerabilities in products from leading IT and ICS vendors. He become well known for a broader SCADA/ICS audience in year 2012 when he participated in the Digitalbond's project basecamp where a couple of security researcher tested the security of ICS equipment. Ruben had said that the underlying problem is that some of these 'attacks' are actually features documented in the their protocol, so again "any legit functionality supported by the controller could also be used by a malicious user". During the last couple of months Ruben have been in the media after exposing vulnerabilities in Satellite Communications (SATCOM) systems, who plays a vital role in the global telecommunications system, read more about this in his article A Wake-up Call for SATCOM Security.

        Kim Zetter is an award-winning investigative journalist and author who covers cybersecurity, cybercrime, cyber warfare, and civil liberties. She has been covering computer security and the hacking underground since 1999, first for PC World magazine, and now for Wired, where she has been reporting since 2003 and is currently a senior staff writer. She has broken numerous stories over the years about hacking, WikiLeaks, and NSA surveillance and has three times been voted one of the top 10 security reporters in the nation by her journalism peers and security industry professionals.

        In 2006 she broke a story for Salon.com about a secret NSA room at an AT&T facility in Missouri that was believed to be siphoning internet data from the telecom’s network operations center.

        In 2007 she wrote a groundbreaking three-part story for Wired on the cybercriminal underground, which exposed the world of online carding markets and the players behind them.

        In 2010, she and a Wired colleague broke the story about the arrest of Bradley Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst accused of leaking millions of classified U.S. government documents to WikiLeaks.

        In 2011, she wrote an extensive feature about Stuxnet, a sophisticated digital weapon that was launched by the U.S. and Israel to sabotage Iran’s uranium enrichment program. She recently completed a book on the topic titled Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World&#8217;s First Digital Weapon published by Crown/Random House in November 2014.

      description: |
        The ICS threat landscape is mostly unknown. We have a lot of stories of attacks but most are hyped up. And from trusted sources we have metrics on incidents but they tell a very different story than intended sometimes. In this presentation, the current ICS threat landscape will be explored, deficiencies in it will be explained, and recommendations for the community will be given to help ensure we shine a light on a dark corner in the community.

      description: |
        Innovative and disruptive technologies are enhancing and invading our traditional industrial business model. Future infrastructure organizations will need more data to operate efficiently and succeed in the brave new interconnected world.
        
        The diversity of new technologies and data will fuel more diversity in business opportunity. Everyone expects more OT, more IOT, and more IT - and all of it is supposed to be highly reliable and secure. 
        
        These factors (and more) lead to a landscape shift for the industrial cybersecurity risk profile. In this session, hear ways to recognize the problems and gain some clarity on possible solutions through historic lessons, made up words, and practical front-line experience.

      description: |
        Back in 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world’s largest businesses – from drug manufacturers to software developers to shipping companies.

        At the attack’s epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damage – the largest, most devastating cyberattack the world had ever seen.

      image: jasper-hooft
      bio: For more than 8 years, I worked around the world as automation programmer and maintenance/commissioning engineer. During this period, I obtained in-depth experience in various ICS environments (PLC and DCS) in different sectors (petrochemical, food and feed and many others). Now as a Toreon ICS Security Consultant I leverage this knowledge to provide advice on security architecture for clients in the utilities sector in Europe. At those clients, I help to improve the security maturity level of their organisations. I achieve this by organising Threat Modeling sessions with our customers to identify the vulnerabilities in their ICS environment. I consider Threat Modeling to be the most fitting risk assessment methodology for Industrial environments. Its scenario-based approach makes it easy for people of different profiles to add value to the process.

      bio: Jimmy Wylie is a Senior Adversary Hunter at Dragos who spends his days (and nights) searching for and analyzing threats to critical infrastructure. Born and raised in New Orleans, he studied Computer Science at the University of New Orleans, where he received his Bachelor’s in 2009 and his Master’s in 2012. During that time, he was introduced to reverse engineering in a university-level malware analysis class. The class went well, and he continued to tinker with it as a hobby. However, the thought of doing reverse engineering for a living only slightly surpassed his desire to sleep on a bed of nails.

      subject: The cyber-attack on Hydro
      description: |
        Back in 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world’s largest businesses – from drug manufacturers to software developers to shipping companies.
        
        At the attack’s epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damage – the largest, most devastating cyberattack the world had ever seen.

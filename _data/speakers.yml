  bio: Joe Slowik has extensive network security and computer network operations experience spanning the military, intelligence, and nuclear communities. Joe served as an Information Warfare Officer in the US Navy from 2009 to 2014, where he brought cybersecurity and network operations experience to places as varied as the mountains of Afghanistan to the Pacific Ocean. Following his military service, Joe moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), working as a threat and malware analyst and leading the incident response team. While at LANL, Joe led efforts to completely revise threat hunting and intelligence operations to make network security more agile and responsive to the threat environment, such as tracking network infrastructure creation and malware development by nation state actors of interest. Joe joined Dragos Inc in April 2017 to focus his research and efforts on the ICS threat landscape, where he now applies his passion for defense to the critical infrastructure and industrial control ecosystem.

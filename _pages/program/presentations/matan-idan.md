IT/OT Convergence is a major challenge for industrial organizations on the path to digitalization.

The volume and variety of security products as well as the standards for OT networks is growing at a fast pace. As a result, the need for deep expertise, required to sort through and select the right systems for specific industry needs, grows even faster.

In our session we will present a promising new initiative designed to simplify digitalization processes and test the efficiency and relevance of OT security tools before they are placed in the network.

Weâ€™ll present the results of our latest research which studied the unique Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of OT attacks and devised a method to test them in a simulated lab environment.

The research included the implementation of tens of new techniques and OT use cases over a MITRE's Caldera platform, an open-source advisory emulation platform. The research was further expanded by implementing the recently published "ATT&CK for ICS" model, and also will point some improvements for the existing model.

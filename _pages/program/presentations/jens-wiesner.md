In many industries Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) are considered the last line of defense to prevent catastrophic events – even if control over a facility is lost - SIS have to prevent damage for human and environment by forcing the process to a defined safe condition.

Taking into account the recently becoming known attempts to disrupt Critical Infrastructures the expectations into the capabilities of SIS are quite high. But with the progressing integration and merging of IT and OT even specialized SIS could
be using standard hard- and software which might be compromised more easily. Additionally the personnel used to dealing with functional safety usually are no IT security experts and are being confronted with a whole new ruleset where the protection goals are different to IT and OT! While in IT confidentiality usually is the primary goal, in OT it is availability, but Integrity being the most important in SIS is often considered subordinate.

Practical adaptation of normative requirements (like IEC 61511 and ISA-TR84.00.09) are currently quite vague. This talk will present the result of over a year’s work of NAMUR* and BSI which lead after controversial discussions to a thorough, yet practical approach to define state of the art procedures and best practices.

*NAMUR, the "User Association of Automation Technology in Process Industries", an international association of user companies (established in 1949) which represents their interests concerning automation technology had established a working group dealing with these questions.

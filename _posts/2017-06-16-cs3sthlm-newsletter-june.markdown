Outline of this short newsletter

- CFP work
- Announced speakers
- Technical Trainings
- Social events
- Early Bird tickets
- Venue
- Conference Hotel

We want to share some info about the recent development.

We will carry on the tradition from when we where called 4SICS - to be a leading international conference on SCADA, ICS and critical infrastructure cyber security! We will have multiple stages with the best international speakers and trainers, having excellent social activities and provide hard-to-earn knowledge, no matter if it is deeply technical matters, sucessful solutions or policy briefs.

In the program comittee, we are working with the submissions that we have received as the CFP closed. We have alot more submissions than available speaker slots! And still not all slots are for submitted proposals, but we have reserved some slots for invited speakers as well. Thus it is really hard to make the selection this year.

### Announced speakers

We have announced a couple of speakers already, especially since they are related to investigations into the recently unveiled industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE malware:

- Joe Slowik of Dragos Inc (US), who will speak on "Strategic Network Defense in ICS Environments"
- The ESET team (SK) who have a presentation on "Industroyer: biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet"

We will have a special panel on the Ukraine 2016 event with detailed discussion, where both the ESET and Dragos specialists will attend. We plan to add more experts to this discussion.

More speakers will be announced in the weeks to come, including keynote speakers!

### Technical trainings

We will have a number of technical trainings related to network forenics, honeypots, hacking, etc.

* Erik Hjelmvik of Netresec (SE) will have a 2 day Network Forensic class
* Mikael Vingaard (DK) will have a 1 day Honeypot class

Thus, with the addition of 2 day training classes, the pre-conference activity will start already on the 23rd of october!

#### Social Events

We will have a welcome reception on the evening of the 24th and a conference dinner on the 25th.

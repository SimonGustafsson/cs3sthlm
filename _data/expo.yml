      description: |
        There has been much speculation (not to mention exaggeration) over recent years about the fabled dark web. We’ve heard how this shady underworld is the refuge of the cyber criminal elite. That this is their “Wolf’s Lair,” where they gather to plot the breaching of businesses and the hacking of celebrities amongst other activities.

        ### This presentation will feature:

        * A definition of the dark web and how it differs from other sources of intelligence
        * Real-world examples of threat actor activities in dark marketplaces
        * Methods for uncovering emerging threats using dark web sources

      subject: Security when failure is not an option.

      description: |
        Sometimes the consequences of failure are simply not acceptable. When loss of life is at stake or when a failure means compromising highly classified secrets – the cyber security strategy must be adjusted accordingly. Much of today’s cyber security is just about reacting faster to failures. This presentation discusses how to adopt proactive strategies that are effective against tomorrows threats – today.

      subject: Addressing Physical to Digital Convergence in an Evolving World

      description: |
        The momentum behind the convergence of historically distinct and separate domains illuminates the importance of seeking to implement robust security to protect highly valued assets that are In many instances delivering essential global services.

        The stakes in the game of outmaneuvering the adversary to protect Operational Technology Critical infrastructure (OTCI) have never been higher as the attack surface expands due to increased adoption of IP for business efficiency.  Operational technology security products and services aim to protect existing and evolving OT for industrial and commercial critical infrastructure systems.  Security and risk management leaders should gauge the market state and direction, and understand the types of OT security providers in the market.

        Fortinet developed and markets an OTCI environmental solution that is based upon the integration of Fortinet’s Security Fabric. This global responsibility entails Fortinet enabling the integration of a scalable technology to ensure the safety, protection, visibility, and control of all these critical infrastructure systems. Mr. Peters will discuss the digital and security transformation that has taken place due to IT/OT convergence that resulted in OT systems fusing with corporate IT systems.

        The audience will also get a cybersecurity architectural glimpse of how these systems are protected by Fortinet’s Security Fabric.

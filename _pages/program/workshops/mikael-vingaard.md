This 1-day workshop would start with a short general introduction to ICS/SCADA & Honeypots.

During the day, the students will be guided in the different phases in planning, deploying and analyzing the collected data from a honeypot. During the day, we will deploy live honeypots on the internet and see how attackers would start to probe our honeypots. Furthermore, we will also attack the deployed honeypots ourselves; using SCADA pen testing tools and similar software.

### Course syllabus
* Introduction to Honeypots systems, with special focus on ICS/SCADA.
* Building and Deployment of a live honeypot on the internet.
Â•* Useful tools to pentest SCADA honeypot systems
* How to read the logs, and spot different attack types
* Useful modification of the honeypot configuration
* Closing remark and ideas for further activities.

Each student will get access to a numbers of virtual lab servers to learn how to deploy and customize settings to avoid the default honeypot signature.

The instructor runs (probably) one of the largest privately owned ICS honeynets, and will during the day provide his hard-earned honeypot expertise and present personal research showcases of e.g. how to detect Zero-days via Honeypot deployments.

### Takeaway for participants

After this 1 day workshop, you will be able to plan and deploy an ICS/SCADA open source honeypot network, either for research or to defend your corporate assets.

You will leave the class room with a knowledge on how to change the default signature on the honeypots and and understanding of the most common tools who will attack your honeypots.

### Requirements

Students must bring a suitable laptop able to connect to the Internet.  It must have a SSH client (Putty/term or similar software) installed.

All lab servers are based on the internet, so no hypervisor like Vmware/VirtualBox are required on the student device.

Knowledge of basic Linux commands, text editor and usage of the command line would be beneficial, but not a strict requirement to benefit from this course.

### Workshop Level

Beginner to Intermediate

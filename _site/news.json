      "content_html": "2017 was indeed a remarkable year, and some of the cyber security related things that happened will surely be remembered. Among them was the Wannacry malware hospitals, industrial companies and other important infrastructure. Things that also hit the front pages were outbreak that blindly struck against the analysis of Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE (ICS malware attacking Ukraine grid operator) and recently the TRITON/TRISIS/Hatman (attack tool against safety system). In Sweden, IT security incidents led to the resignation of two ministers from the government, and a journalists use of Shodan led to that one of Swedens largest news room had a series of reports on what is Internet accessible, when they found heating/hydropower/windpower/elevators and more, sitting on the Internet for anyone to access.The CS3STHLM 2017 summit (previously known as 4SICS) had several presentations related to all these issues. As a holiday gift for you, we have now published a number of presentations on our YouTube channel: CS3STHLM at YouTubeNext year we will be back for the fifth time and the dates are October 22nd-25th. We are already on the lookout for summit content, so do let us know what you think we should present in order to make next years workshops and conference as useful and rewarding as possible.Another holiday gift is that we already have opened the ticket sale for 2018 with a special Earliest Bird discount of 30 % on the two-day conference ticket. Link: www.cs3sthlm.se and the discounted ticket is available until January 12th. A very happy holiday season - from all of us, to all of you!  The CS3STHLM crew"

      "content_html": "In the light of growing vulnerabilities, this year’s top summit on Cyber Security in Industrial Control Systems and Critical Infrastructure will give delegates possibilities to partake in real-time simulations and challenges in an updated and bigger ICS lab. The lab is hosted by ROMAB, Norwegian Energy CERT and equipment provided by the Norwegian National Security Authority, NSM. The summit takes place in Stockholm October 24-26.This year the lab is declared to be bigger, better and more interesting than ever before with added ICS and ICS communication equipment to the lab. New equipment has resulted in a simulation of communication in industrial control systems with some ICS specific protocols including OPC communication being in progress. It is also extended with a part that is for IoT security. The Internet of things, (IoT), is the network of physical devices, vehicles, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.Margrete Raaum from Norwegian Energy CERT:  -”Nothing gives as valuable cyber security learning as real hands-on work. Teaming up with ROMAB to create a dynamic and realistic learning environment is exciting, and we hope this will benefit ICS security engineers all over Scandinavia and beyond”This year there is a much larger team involved in setting up, running the lab, or have special tasks involving the lab during the conference. The team members include Lars-Erik Smevold of KraftCERT (NO) who will be in charge of the lab, Nicklas Keijser (SE), who is an expert on SCADA/ICS development, Robert Malmgren (SE) of ROMAB, Erik Hjelmvik (SE) of NETRESEC and Mikael Vingaard (DK).Robert Malmgren, founder of CS3STHLM and owner of ROMAB elaborates:  -”We are honored to have the Norwegian energy sector CERT KraftCERT, as cooperators to ROMAB in setting up this year hosting the ICS and IoT security lab! This is a truly great partnership over the border with our Scandinavian friends in an effort to build competence and relationships for all that strive to secure the society and its critical infrastructure by starting with its fundamentals - the very systems that run our basic functions, like the electrical grid. Thank you to the Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM)  to lending out equipment to the lab”"

      "content_html": "The 4th edition of the top international summit on SCADA/ICS and critical infrastructure includes a seminar called ’Effective threat mitigation strategies’ hosted by Advenica. The company is providing new ways in cyber security, protecting critical infrastructures with innovative solutions.One of the founders of CS3STHLM, Robert Malmgren, expresses excitement over the collaboration;  ” This fits perfectly with our profile and we are looking forward to learn about Advenica’s new security solutions.”Advenica elaborates  ”Last years have presented an increasing number of bumps in the road for cyber security defenders. The vast number of different attack vectors and the explosion in number of malware variants has made yesterday’s cyber defense strategies obsolete. The goal of cyber security is to ensure robust operation of the defended system – not to find as many pieces of malware as possible. Yesterday’s strategy is efficient at finding malware – but fail in ensuring robust operation”.CS3STHLM is an international summit that focus entirely on cyber security protection of SCADA/ICS and critical infrastructure. CS3STHLM attracts about 250-300 people from around the world to meet, network and gain knowledge. CS3STHLM takes place October 23-26 at the venue Nalen in central Stockholm."

      "content_html": "Researchers from Slovakian Anti Virus company ESET have publicized information on malware especially targeted for automation in power grids. The malware is tied to an attack in Ukraine 2016. ESET have worked alongside researchers from another company, Dragos, to analyze the code. Investigators from ESET and Dragos will come to Cyber Security Summit CS3STHLM in Stockholm in October to present and discuss their findings.Robert Lipovski, one of the researchers at ESET, states in Washington Post:  “The potential impact of malware like this is huge. It’s not restricted to Ukraine. The industrial hardware that the malware communicates with is used in critical infrastructure worldwide.”This malware is called the most dangerous code since Stuxnet, malware discovered in 2010 aimed specifically towards Iran’s nuclear program.Robert Malmgren, owner and co-founder of CS3STHLM:  ” The fact that this malware can be used and re-used in critical infrastructure everywhere makes it an enormous threat to non protected Industrial Control Systems.”CS3STHLM takes place at Nalen in Stockholm October 24-26.www.cs3sthlm.seFor more information regarding the malware, please contactRobert MalmgrenPhone: +46 708 33 03 78"

This presentation will cover and explain what TSCM (Technical surveillance Counter Measures) a.k.a. "Bug sweeping" is, how it is performed, the tools, the methodology and how not it shall be performed. The presentation and on stage demo will show how hard and complex the procedure is and to educate persons and organizations to procure and understand the subject. But most importantly to expose those who do it as a secret "voodoo ritual" just to make money.

In this talk, we discuss how properties of the wireless medium and wireless devices can be utilized to enhance wireless security. We start with a short review of so-called physical-layer security techniques and then study intrusion detection at the physical layer in detail. We give examples for features that can be utilized, we discuss necessary conditions for a reliable detection performance and their impact on system parameters, and we analyze how packet filtering at the physical layer impacts the delay performance of the system.

Regardless of the type and scale of the vessels that we test in our security assessments there are a  set of common security issues that always seem to be present. Whether it’s a Moss Maritime CS55  deep water exploration drilling rig, a Neo-Panamax container ship, a re-supply vessel, a seabed  survey vessel, or a brand-new cruise ship on its shakedown voyage, some things just keep cropping  up.

We’ll talk about the distinct lack of understanding and interaction between IT and OT  installers/engineers on board and in the yard. The issue here is that OT systems are often accessible  from the IT systems and vice versa, often through deliberate bypass of security features by those on  board, or through poor design / poor password management / weak patch management.

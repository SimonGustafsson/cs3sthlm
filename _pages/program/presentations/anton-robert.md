Industroyer is unique and extremely dangerous malware designed to disrupt critical industrial processes. This malware was involved in the December 2016 attack on Ukraine’s power grid. What sets Industroyer apart from other malware targeting infrastructure, such as BlackEnergy (a.k.a. SandWorm), is its ability to control switches and circuit breakers directly via 4 different industrial communication protocols. As the protocols and hardware targeted by Industroyer are employed in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems, like water and gas, worldwide, this discovery should serve as a wake-up call for those responsible for security of these critical systems.
